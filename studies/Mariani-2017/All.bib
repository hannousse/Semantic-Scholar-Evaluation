	Abstract = {Many studies reported that software maintenance, traditionally defined as any modification made on a software system after its delivery, consumes up to 90% of the total cost of a typical software project. Adding new functionalities, correcting bugs, and modifying the code to improve its quality are major parts of those costs. To ease these maintenance activities, one of the most used techniques is the refactoring which improves design structure while preserving the external behavior. In general, refactoring is performed through two main steps: (1) detection of code fragments corresponding to design defects that need to be improved/fixed and (2) identification of refactoring solutions to achieve this goal. Our research project targets the automation of these two refactoring steps. Concretely, we consider the detection step as a search-based process to find the suitable detection rules for each type of design defect, by means of a genetic algorithm. To guide the rule-derivation process, real examples of design defects are used. For the refactoring identification step, a multiobjective search-based approach is also used. The process aims at finding the optimal sequence of refactoring operations that improve the software quality by minimizing the number of detected defects. In addition, we explore other objectives to optimize: the effort needed to apply refactorings, semantic preservation, and the similarity with good refactorings applied in the past to similar contexts. Hence, the effort corresponds to the code modification/adaptation score needed to apply the suggested refactoring solutions. On the other hand, the semantic preservation insures that the refactored program is semantically equivalent to the original one, and that it models correctly the domain semantics. Indeed, we use knowledge from historical code changes to propose new refactoring solutions in similar contexts to improve the automation of refactoring.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Object-oriented systems that undergo repeated addition of functionality commonly suffer a loss of quality in their underlying design. This problem must often be remedied in a costly refactoring phase before further maintenance programming can take place. Recently search-based approaches to automating the task of software refactoring, based on the concept of treating object-oriented design as a combinatorial optimization problem, have been proposed. However, because search-based refactoring is a novel approach it is yet to be established as to which search techniques are most suitable for the task. In this paper we report the results of an empirical comparison of simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithms (GAs) and multiple ascent hill-climbing (HCM) in search-based refactoring. A prototype automated refactoring tool is employed, capable of making radical changes to the design of an existing program in order that it conforms more closely to a contemporary quality model. Results show HCM to outperform both SA and GA over a set of five input programs. Copyright {\copyright} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Refactoring is performed to improve software quality while leaving the behaviour of the system unchanged. In practice there are many opportunities for refactoring, however, due to conflicts and dependencies between refactorings, only certain orders of refactorings are applicable. Selecting and ordering an appropriate set of refactorings is a challenging task for a developer. We propose a novel automated approach to scheduling refactorings according to their conflicts and dependencies as well as their contribution to design quality expressed by a desired design. The desired design is an improved version of the current program design, and is produced by the developer. Our approach is capable of detecting conflicts and dependencies between refactorings, and uses a sequence alignment algorithm to identify the degree of similarity between two program designs expressed as sequence of characters, thereby measuring the contribution of a refactoring to achieving the desired design. We evaluated our approach on several sample programs and one non-trivial open source application. Our results demonstrate the ability of the approach to order the input refactorings so as to achieve the desired design even in the presence of intense inter-refactoring conflict and dependency, and when applied to a medium-sized, real-world application.},
