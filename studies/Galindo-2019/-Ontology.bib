	Abstract = {Configurable reference process models encompass common and variable processes of organizations from different business domains. These reference process models are designed and reused to guide and derive customized business processes according to the requirements of stakeholders. The customization process is generally initiated by a configuration step, selecting a subset of the reference process model. Configuration is followed by a customization step, which assumes adapting or extending the configured business process based on the specific or unforeseen requirements. Hence, it is crucial to validate the correctness and compliance of the final customized business process with respect to the patterns and business constraints that are specified in the reference model. In this paper, we firstly introduce a technique to develop a customized process model and then present a set of identified inconsistency patterns that may happen during the configuration of a reference model and the customization of configured process models. Furthermore, we describe our proposed approach including formal representations and algorithms that provide logical reasoning and enable automatic inconsistency detection by leveraging description logic. In order to explore the scalability of the approach, we designed the experiments with various process models sizes and inconsistency distributions. The results of the experiments revealed the scalability of our approach with large size process models (500 activities).},

	Abstract = {Metamodels evolve over time, which can break the conformance between the models and the metamodel. Model migration strategies aim to co-evolve models and metamodels together, but their application is currently not fully automatizable and is thus cumbersome and error prone. We introduce the Variable MetaModel (VMM) strategy to address the evolution of the reusable model assets of a model-based Software Product Line. The VMM strategy applies variability modeling ideas to express the evolution of the metamodel in terms of commonalities and variabilities. When the metamodel evolves, changes are automatically formalized into the VMM and models that conform to previous versions of the metamodel continue to conform to the VMM, thus eliminating the need for migration. We have applied both the traditional migration strategy and the VMM strategy to a retrospective case study that includes 13years of evolution of our industrial partner, an induction hobs manufacturer. The comparison between the two strategies shows better results for the VMM strategy in terms of model indirection, automation, and trust leak.},

	Abstract = {Context
Feature models are commonly used to capture and communicate the commonality and variability of features in a Software Product Line. The core component of Feature models is feature diagrams, which graphically depict features in a hierarchical form. In previous work we have proposed a new notation that aims to improve the cognitive effectiveness of feature diagrams.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to empirically validate the cognitive effectiveness of the new feature diagrams notation in comparison to its original form.
Methods
We use two distinct empirical user-studies to validate the new notation. The first empirical study uses the survey approach while the second study is a subject-based experiment. The survey study investigates the semantic transparency of the new notation while the second study investigates the speed and accuracy of reading the notation.
Results
The results of the studies indicate that the proposed changes have significantly improved its cognitive effectiveness.
Conclusions
The cognitive effectiveness of feature diagrams has been improved, however there remains further research for full acceptance of the new notation by its potential user community.},
