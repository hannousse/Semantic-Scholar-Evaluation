	Abstract = {A feature model is an essential tool to identify variability and commonality within a product line of an enterprise, assisting stakeholders to configure product lines and to discover opportunities for reuse. However, the number of product variants needed to satisfy individual customer needs is still an open question, as feature models do not incorporate any direct customer preference information. In this paper, we propose to incorporate customer preference information into feature models using sentiment analysis of user-generated online product reviews. The proposed sentiment analysis method is a hybrid combination of affective lexicons and a rough-set technique. It is able to predict sentence sentiments for individual product features with acceptable accuracy, and thus augment a feature model by integrating positive and negative opinions of the customers. Such opinionated customer preference information is regarded as one attribute of the features, which helps to decide the number of variants needed within a product line. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed method via an application case of Kindle Fire HD tablets.},

@article{Xue:2016,
	Abstract = {Software configuration, which aims to customize the software for different users (e.g., Linux kernel configuration), is an important and complicated task. In software product line engineering (SPLE), feature oriented domain analysis is adopted and feature model is used to guide the configuration of new product variants. In SPLE, product configuration is an optimal feature selection problem, which needs to find a set of features that have no conflicts and meanwhile achieve multiple design objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing the number of features). In previous studies, several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used for the optimal feature selection problem and indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) was proven to be the best MOEA for this problem. However, IBEA still suffers from the issues of correctness and diversity of found solutions. In this paper, we propose a dual-population evolutionary algorithm, named IBED, to achieve both correctness and diversity of solutions. In IBED, two populations are individually evolved with two different types of evolutionary operators, i.e., IBEA operators and differential evolution (DE) operators. Furthermore, we propose two enhancement techniques for existing MOEAs, namely the feedback-directed mechanism to fast find the correct solutions (e.g., solutions that satisfy the feature model constraints) and the preprocessing method to reduce the search space. Our empirical results have shown that IBED with the enhancement techniques can outperform several state-of-the-art MOEAs on most case studies in terms of correctness and diversity of found solutions.},

@article{White:2014,
	Abstract = {The increasing complexity and cost of software-intensive systems has led developers to seek ways of reusing software components across development projects. One approach to increasing software reusability is to develop a software product-line (SPL), which is a software architecture that can be reconfigured and reused across projects. Rather than developing software from scratch for a new project, a new configuration of the SPL is produced. It is hard, however, to find a configuration of an SPL that meets an arbitrary requirement set and does not violate any configuration constraints in the SPL. Existing research has focused on techniques that produce a configuration of an SPL in a single step. Budgetary constraints or other restrictions, however, may require multi-step configuration processes. For example, an aircraft manufacturer may want to produce a series of configurations of a plane over a span of years without exceeding a yearly budget to add features. This paper provides three contributions to the study of multi-step configuration for SPLs. First, we present a formal model of multi-step SPL configuration and map this model to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Second, we show how solutions to these SPL configuration problems can be automatically derived with a constraint solver by mapping them to CSPs. Moreover, we show how feature model changes can be mapped to our approach in a multi-step scenario by using feature model drift. Third, we present empirical results demonstrating that our CSP-based reasoning technique can scale to SPL models with hundreds of features and multiple configuration steps.},

@article{White:2010,
	Abstract = {Software product-lines (SPLs) are software platforms that can be readily reconfigured for different project requirements. A key part of an SPL is a model that captures the rules for reconfiguring the software. SPLs commonly use feature models to capture SPL configuration rules. Each SPL configuration is represented as a selection of features from the feature model. Invalid SPL configurations can be created due to feature conflicts introduced via staged or parallel configuration or changes to the constraints in a feature model. When invalid configurations are created, a method is needed to automate the diagnosis of the errors and repair the feature selections. This paper provides two contributions to research on automated configuration of SPLs. First, it shows how configurations and feature models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems to automatically diagnose errors and repair invalid feature selections. Second, it presents empirical results from diagnosing configuration errors in feature models ranging in size from 100 to 5,000 features. The results of our experiments show that our CSP-based diagnostic technique can scale up to models with thousands of features.},

@article{Wang:2015,
	Abstract = {Cost-effective testing of a product in a product line requires obtaining a set of relevant test cases from the entire test suite via test selection and minimization techniques. In this paper, we particularly focus on test minimization for product lines, which identifies and eliminates redundant test cases from test suites in order to reduce the total number of test cases to execute, thereby improving the efficiency of testing. However, such minimization may result in the minimized test suite with low test coverage, low fault revealing capability, low priority test cases, and require more time than the allowed testing budget (e.g., time) as compared to the original test suite. To deal with the above issues, we formulated the minimization problem as a search problem and defined a fitness function considering various optimization objectives based on the above issues. To assess the performance of our fitness function, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation by investigating the fitness function with three weight-based Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and seven multi-objective search algorithms using an industrial case study and 500 artificial problems inspired from the industrial case study. The results show that Random-Weighted Genetic Algorithm (RWGA) significantly outperforms the other algorithms since RWGA can balance all the objectives together by dynamically updating weights during each generation. Based on the results of our empirical evaluation, we also implemented a tool called TEst Minimization using Search Algorithms (TEMSA) to support test minimization using various search algorithms in the context of product lines.},

Coping with evolution in automated production systems implies a cross-disciplinary challenge along the system's life-cycle for variant-rich systems of high complexity. The authors from computer science and automation provide an interdisciplinary survey on challenges and state of the art in evolution of automated production systems. Selected challenges are illustrated on the case of a simple pick and place unit. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the development process of automated production systems as well as the different type of evolutions during the system's life-cycle on the case of a pick and place unit. In the second part, we survey the challenges associated with evolution in the different development phases and a couple of cross-cutting areas and review existing approaches addressing the challenges. We close with summarizing future research directions to address the challenges of evolution in automated production systems.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a methodology to design robot-oriented generative learning objects (GLOs) that are, in fact, heterogeneous meta-programs to teach computer science (CS) topics such as programming. The methodology includes CS learning variability modelling using the feature-based approaches borrowed from the SW engineering domain. Firstly, we define the CS learning domain using the known educational framework TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy And Content Knowledge). By learning variability we mean the attributes of the framework extracted and represented as feature models with multiple values. Therefore, the CS learning variability represents the problem domain. Meta-programming is considered as a solution domain. Both are represented by feature models. The GLO design task is formulated as mapping the problem domain model on the solution domain model. Next, we present the design framework to design GLOs manually or semi-automatically. The multi-level separation of concepts, model representation and transformation forms the conceptual background. Its theoretical background includes: (a) a formal definition of feature-based models; (b) a graph-based and set-based definition of meta-programming concepts; (c) transformation rules to support the model mapping; (d) a computational Abstract State Machine model to define the processes and design tool for developing GLOs. We present the architecture and some characteristics of the tool. The tool enables to improve the GLO design process significantly (in terms of time and quality) and to achieve a higher quality and functionality of GLOs themselves (in terms of the parameter space enlargement for reuse and adaptation). We demonstrate the appropriateness of the methodology in the real teaching setting. In this paper, we present the case study that analyses three robot-oriented GLOs as the higher-level specifications. Then, using the meta-language processor, we are able to produce, from the specifications, the concrete robot control programs on demand automatically and to demonstrate teaching algorithms visually by robot's actions. We evaluate the approach from technological and pedagogical perspectives using the known structural metrics. Also, we indicate the merits and demerits of the approach. The main contribution and originality of the paper is the seamless integration of two known technologies (feature modelling and meta-programming) in designing robot-oriented GLOs and their supporting tools.},

	Abstract = {Mistakes made when implementing or specifying the models of a Software Product Line (SPL) can result in ill-formed products --- the safe composition problem. Such problem can hinder productivity and it might be hard to detect, since SPLs can have thousands of products. In this article, we propose a language independent approach for verifying safe composition of SPLs with dedicated Configuration Knowledge models. We translate feature model and Configuration Knowledge into propositional logic and use the Alloy Analyzer to perform the verification. To provide evidence for the generality of our approach, we instantiate this approach in different compositional settings. We deal with different kinds of assets such as use case scenarios and Eclipse RCP components. We analyze both the code and the requirements for a larger scale SPL, finding problems that affect thousands of products in minutes. Moreover, our evaluation suggests that the analysis time grows linearly with respect to the number of products in the analyzed SPLs.},

	Abstract = {Context: Feature model is an appropriate and indispensable tool for modeling similarities and differences among products of the Software Product Line (SPL). It not only exposes the validity of the products' configurations in an SPL but also changes in the course of time to support new requirements of the SPL. Modifications made on the feature model in the course of time raise a number of issues. Useless enlargements of the feature model, the existence of dead features, and violated constraints in the feature model are some of the key problems that make its maintenance difficult. Objective: The initial approach to dealing with the above-mentioned problems and improving maintainability of the feature model is refactoring. Refactoring modifies software artifacts in a way that their externally visible behavior does not change. Method: We introduce a method for defining refactoring rules and executing them on the feature model. We use the ATL model transformation language to define the refactoring rules. Moreover, we provide an Alloy model to check the feature model and the safety of the refactorings that are performed on it. Results: In this research, we propose a safe framework for refactoring a feature model. This framework enables users to perform automatic and semi-automatic refactoring on the feature model. Conclusions: Automated tool support for refactoring is a key issue for adopting approaches such as utilizing feature models and integrating them into the software development process of companies. In this work, we define some of the important refactoring rules on the feature model and provide tools that enable users to add new rules using the ATL M2M language. Our framework assesses the correctness of the refactorings using the Alloy language.},

	Abstract = {Deriving products from a Feature Model (FM) for testing Software Product Lines (SPLs) is a hard task. It is important to select a minimum number of products but, at the same time, to consider the coverage of testing criteria such as pairwise, among other factors. To solve such problems Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied. However, to design a solution for this and other software engineering problems can be very difficult, because it is necessary to choose among different search operators and parameters. Hyper-heuristics can help in this task, and have raised interest in the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. Considering the growing adoption of SPL in the industry and crescent demand for SPL testing approaches, this paper introduces a hyper-heuristic approach to automatically derive products to variability testing of SPLs. The approach works with MOEAs and two selection methods, random and based on FRR-MAB (Fitness Rate Rank based Multi-Armed Bandit). It was evaluated with real FMs and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional algorithms used in the literature, and that both selection methods present similar performance.},

	Abstract = {A feature model is a compact representation of the products of a software product line. The automated extraction of information from feature models is a thriving topic involving numerous analysis operations, techniques and tools. Performance evaluations in this domain mainly rely on the use of random feature models. However, these only provide a rough idea of the behaviour of the tools with average problems and are not sufficient to reveal their real strengths and weaknesses. In this article, we propose to model the problem of finding computationally hard feature models as an optimization problem and we solve it using a novel evolutionary algorithm for optimized feature models (ETHOM). Given a tool and an analysis operation, ETHOM generates input models of a predefined size maximizing aspects such as the execution time or the memory consumption of the tool when performing the operation over the model. This allows users and developers to know the performance of tools in pessimistic cases providing a better idea of their real power and revealing performance bugs. Experiments using ETHOM on a number of analyses and tools have successfully identified models producing much longer executions times and higher memory consumption than those obtained with random models of identical or even larger size.},

	Abstract = {Context
A feature model (FM) represents the valid combinations of features in a domain. The automated extraction of information from FMs is a complex task that involves numerous analysis operations, techniques and tools. Current testing methods in this context are manual and rely on the ability of the tester to decide whether the output of an analysis is correct. However, this is acknowledged to be time-consuming, error-prone and in most cases infeasible due to the combinatorial complexity of the analyses, this is known as the oracle problem.
Objective
In this paper, we propose using metamorphic testing to automate the generation of test data for feature model analysis tools overcoming the oracle problem. An automated test data generator is presented and evaluated to show the feasibility of our approach.
Method
We present a set of relations (so-called metamorphic relations) between input FMs and the set of products they represent. Based on these relations and given a FM and its known set of products, a set of neighbouring FMs together with their corresponding set of products are automatically generated and used for testing multiple analyses. Complex FMs representing millions of products can be efficiently created by applying this process iteratively.
Results
Our evaluation results using mutation testing and real faults reveal that most faults can be automatically detected within a few seconds. Two defects were found in FaMa and another two in SPLOT, two real tools for the automated analysis of feature models. Also, we show how our generator outperforms a related manual suite for the automated analysis of feature models and how this suite can be used to guide the automated generation of test cases obtaining important gains in efficiency.
Conclusion
Our results show that the application of metamorphic testing in the domain of automated analysis of feature models is efficient and effective in detecting most faults in a few seconds without the need for a human oracle.},

	Abstract = {Context
Feature models are commonly used to capture and communicate the commonality and variability of features in a Software Product Line. The core component of Feature models is feature diagrams, which graphically depict features in a hierarchical form. In previous work we have proposed a new notation that aims to improve the cognitive effectiveness of feature diagrams.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to empirically validate the cognitive effectiveness of the new feature diagrams notation in comparison to its original form.
Methods
We use two distinct empirical user-studies to validate the new notation. The first empirical study uses the survey approach while the second study is a subject-based experiment. The survey study investigates the semantic transparency of the new notation while the second study investigates the speed and accuracy of reading the notation.
Results
The results of the studies indicate that the proposed changes have significantly improved its cognitive effectiveness.
Conclusions
The cognitive effectiveness of feature diagrams has been improved, however there remains further research for full acceptance of the new notation by its potential user community.},

	Abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPL) are an engineering technique to efficiently derive a set of similar products from a set of shared assets. In particular in conjunction with model-driven engineering, SPL engineering promises high productivity benefits. There is however, a lack of support for systematic management of SPL evolution, which is an important success factor as a product line often represents a long term investment. In this article, we present a model-driven approach for managing SPL evolution on feature level. To reduce complexity we use model fragments to cluster related elements. The relationships between these fragments are specified using feature model concepts itself leading to a specific kind of feature model called EvoFM. A configuration of EvoFM represents an evolution step and can be transformed to a concrete instance of the product line (i.e., a feature model for the corresponding point in time). Similarly, automatic transformations allow the derivation of an EvoFM from a given set of feature models. This enables retrospective analysis of historic evolution and serves as a starting point for introduction of EvoFM, e.g., to plan future evolution steps.},

	Abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPL) are difficult to validate due to combinatorics induced by variability, which in turn leads to combinatorial explosion of the number of derivable products. Exhaustive testing in such a large products space is hardly feasible. Hence, one possible option is to test SPLs by generating test configurations that cover all possible t feature interactions (t-wise). It dramatically reduces the number of test products while ensuring reasonable SPL coverage. In this paper, we report our experience on applying t-wise techniques for SPL with two independent toolsets developed by the authors. One focuses on generality and splits the generation problem according to strategies. The other emphasizes providing efficient generation. To evaluate the respective merits of the approaches, measures such as the number of generated test configurations and the similarity between them are provided. By applying these measures, we were able to derive useful insights for pairwise and t-wise testing of product lines.},

Every software system must evolve at all levels of abstraction (models, architecture, source code, documentation, etc.) to meet changing user and context requirements. To assess the extent of a change, change impact analysis must be performed. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of change aspects in feature modelling domain, and analyse changeability of feature models, a high level representation of system's external user-visible characteristics. We propose the change impact model based on a feature dependency matrix to assess validity of feature change, to follow feature change propagation and to estimate changeability of a feature model using a Jaccard distance measure. The model is implemented using Prolog logic rules. A case study is presented.},

	Abstract = {Mobile applications require dynamic reconfiguration services (DRS) to self-adapt their behavior to the context changes (e.g., scarcity of resources). Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) are a well-accepted approach to manage runtime variability, by means of late binding the variation points at runtime. During the system's execution, the DRS deploys different configurations to satisfy the changing requirements according to a multiobjective criterion (e.g., insufficient battery level, requested quality of service). Search-based software engineering and, in particular, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), can generate valid configurations of a DSPL at runtime. Several approaches use MOEAs to generate optimum configurations of a Software Product Line, but none of them consider DSPLs for mobile devices. In this paper, we explore the use of MOEAs to generate at runtime optimum configurations of the DSPL according to different criteria. The optimization problem is formalized in terms of a Feature Model (FM), a variability model. We evaluate six existing MOEAs by applying them to 12 different FMs, optimizing three different objectives (usability, battery consumption and memory footprint). The results are discussed according to the particular requirements of a DRS for mobile applications, showing that PAES and NSGA-II are the most suitable algorithms for mobile environments.},

	Abstract = {Test case prioritization schedules test cases for execution in an order that attempts to accelerate the detection of faults. The order of test cases is determined by prioritization objectives such as covering code or critical components as rapidly as possible. The importance of this technique has been recognized in the context of Highly-Configurable Systems (HCSs), where the potentially huge number of configurations makes testing extremely challenging. However, current approaches for test case prioritization in HCSs suffer from two main limitations. First, the prioritization is usually driven by a single objective which neglects the potential benefits of combining multiple criteria to guide the detection of faults. Second, instead of using industry-strength case studies, evaluations are conducted using synthetic data, which provides no information about the effectiveness of different prioritization objectives. In this paper, we address both limitations by studying 63 combinations of up to three prioritization objectives in accelerating the detection of faults in the Drupal framework. Results show that non--functional properties such as the number of changes in the features are more effective than functional metrics extracted from the configuration model. Results also suggest that multi-objective prioritization typically results in faster fault detection than mono-objective prioritization.},

	Abstract = {Process-based context-aware applications are increasingly becoming more complex and dynamic. Besides the large sets of process variants to be managed in such dynamic systems, process variants need to be context sensitive in order to accommodate new user requirements and intrinsic complexity. This paradigm shift forces us to defer decisions to runtime where process variants must be customized and executed based on a recognized context. However, there exists a lack of deferral of the entire process variant configuration and execution to perform an automated decision of subsequent variation points at runtime. In this paper, we present a holistic methodology to automatically resolve process variability at runtime. The proposed solution performs a staged configuration considering static and dynamic context data to accomplish effective decision making. We demonstrate our approach by exemplifying a storage operation process in a smart logistics scenario. Our evaluation demonstrates the performance and scalability results of our methodology.},

	Abstract = {Successful software evolves from a single system by adding and changing functionality to keep up with users' demands and to cater to their similar and different requirements. Nowadays it is a common practice to offer a system in many variants such as community, professional, or academic editions. Each variant provides different functionality described in terms of features. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is an effective software development paradigm for this scenario. At the core of SPLE is variability modelling whose goal is to represent the combinations of features that distinguish the system variants using feature models, the de facto standard for such task. As SPLE practices are becoming more pervasive, reverse engineering feature models from the feature descriptions of each individual variant has become an active research subject. In this paper we evaluated, for this reverse engineering task, three standard search based techniques (evolutionary algorithms, hill climbing, and random search) with two objective functions on 74 SPLs. We compared their performance using precision and recall, and found a clear trade-off between these two metrics which we further reified into a third objective function based on Fβ, an information retrieval measure, that showed a clear performance improvement. We believe that this work sheds light on the great potential of search-based techniques for SPLE tasks.},

	Abstract = {The increasing demand for highly customizable manufacturing systems leads to an extreme number of possible machine variants. Feature models are often used to manage this system diversity. The development and maintenance of feature models are error-prone and time-consuming tasks, especially considering industrial-size models with thousands of features. In many cases, engineers might want to focus only on a few features relevant for their own domain. Additionally, each change may lead to anomalies in the feature model. In this paper, we present an approach to provide engineering support by giving user-friendly explanations for hidden dependencies and anomalies in feature models.},

	Abstract = {Mass customization is the new frontier in business competition for both manufacturing and service industries. To improve customer satisfaction, reduce lead-times and shorten costs, families of similar products are built jointly by combining reusable parts that implement the features demanded by the customers. To guarantee the validity of the products derived from mass customization processes, feature dependencies and incompatibilities are usually specified with a variability model. As market demand grows and evolves, variability models become increasingly complex. In such entangled models it is hard to identify which features are essential, dispensable, highly required by other features, or highly incompatible with the remaining features. This paper exposes the limitations of existing approaches to gather such knowledge and provides efficient algorithms to retrieve that information from variability models.},

	Abstract = {Software product line (SPL) techniques handle the construction of customized systems. One of the most common representations of the decisions a customer can make in SPLs is feature models (FMs). An FM represents the relationships among common and variable features in an SPL. Features are a representation of the characteristics in a system that are relevant to customers. FMs are subject to change since the set of features and their relationships can change along an SPL lifecycle. Due to this evolution, the consistency of FMs may be compromised. There exist some approaches to detect and explain inconsistencies in FMs, however this process can take a long time for large FMs. In this paper we present a complementary approach to dealing with inconsistencies in FM evolution scenarios that improves the performance for existing approaches reducing the impact of change to the smallest part of an FM that changes. To achieve our goal, we formalize FMs from an ontological perspective and define constraints that must be satisfied in FMs to be consistent. We define a set of primitive operations that modify FMs and which are responsible for the FM evolution, analyzing their impact on the FM consistency. We propose a set of predefined strategies to keep the consistency for error-prone operations. As a proof-of-concept we present the results of our experiments, where we check for the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in FMs with thousands of features. Although our approach is limited by the kinds of consistency constraints and the primitive operations we define, the experiments present a significant improvement in performance results in those cases where they are applicable.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Software product line (SPL) engineering is a software engineering approach to building configurable software systems. SPLs commonly use a feature model to capture and document the commonalities and variabilities of the underlying software system. A key challenge when using a feature model to derive a new SPL configuration is determining how to find an optimized feature selection that minimizes or maximizes an objective function, such as total cost, subject to resource constraints. To help address the challenges of optimizing feature selection in the face of resource constraints, this paper presents an approach that uses G enetic A lgorithms for optimized FE ature S election (GAFES) in SPLs. Our empirical results show that GAFES can produce solutions with 86--97% of the optimality of other automated feature selection algorithms and in 45--99% less time than existing exact and heuristic feature selection techniques.},

	Abstract = {Context
In industrial settings products are developed by more than one organization. Software vendors and suppliers commonly typically maintain their own product lines, which contribute to a larger (multi) product line or software ecosystem. It is unrealistic to assume that the participating organizations will agree on using a specific variability modeling technique---they will rather use different approaches and tools to manage the variability of their systems.
Objective
We aim to support product configuration in software ecosystems based on several variability models with different semantics that have been created using different notations.
Method
We present an integrative approach that provides a unified perspective to users configuring products in multi product line environments, regardless of the different modeling methods and tools used internally. We also present a technical infrastructure and a prototype implementation based on web services.
Results
We show the feasibility of the approach and its implementation by using it with the three most widespread types of variability modeling approaches in the product line community, i.e., feature-based, OVM-style, and decision-oriented modeling. To demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of our approach, we present an example derived from industrial experience in enterprise resource planning. We further applied the approach to support the configuration of privacy settings in the Android ecosystem based on multiple variability models. We also evaluated the performance of different model enactment strategies used in our approach.
Conclusions
Tools and techniques allowing stakeholders to handle variability in a uniform manner can considerably foster the initiation and growth of software ecosystems from the perspective of software reuse and configuration.},

	Abstract = {Metamodels evolve over time, which can break the conformance between the models and the metamodel. Model migration strategies aim to co-evolve models and metamodels together, but their application is currently not fully automatizable and is thus cumbersome and error prone. We introduce the Variable MetaModel (VMM) strategy to address the evolution of the reusable model assets of a model-based Software Product Line. The VMM strategy applies variability modeling ideas to express the evolution of the metamodel in terms of commonalities and variabilities. When the metamodel evolves, changes are automatically formalized into the VMM and models that conform to previous versions of the metamodel continue to conform to the VMM, thus eliminating the need for migration. We have applied both the traditional migration strategy and the VMM strategy to a retrospective case study that includes 13years of evolution of our industrial partner, an induction hobs manufacturer. The comparison between the two strategies shows better results for the VMM strategy in terms of model indirection, automation, and trust leak.},

	Abstract = {Feature modeling is an approach to represent   commonalities and variabilities among products of a product   line. Context-aware applications use context information to provide   relevant services and information for their users. One of the   challenges to build a context-aware product line is to develop   mechanisms to incorporate context information and adaptation   knowledge in a feature model. This paper presents UbiFEX, an   approach to support feature analysis for context-aware software   product lines, which incorporates a modeling notation and a   mechanism to verify the consistency of product configuration   regarding context variations. Moreover, an experimental study was   performed as a preliminary evaluation, and a prototype was developed   to enable the application of the proposed approach.},

	Abstract = {Cloud computing can reduce power consumption by using virtualized computational resources to provision an application's computational resources on demand. Auto-scaling is an important cloud computing technique that dynamically allocates computational resources to applications to match their current loads precisely, thereby removing resources that would otherwise remain idle and waste power. This paper presents a model-driven engineering approach to optimizing the configuration, energy consumption, and operating cost of cloud auto-scaling infrastructure to create greener computing environments that reduce emissions resulting from superfluous idle resources. The paper provides four contributions to the study of model-driven configuration of cloud auto-scaling infrastructure by (1) explaining how virtual machine configurations can be captured in feature models, (2) describing how these models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) for configuration and energy consumption optimization, (3) showing how optimal auto-scaling configurations can be derived from these CSPs with a constraint solver, and (4) presenting a case study showing the energy consumption/cost reduction produced by this model-driven approach.},

@article{Dermeval:2015,
	Abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a set of software systems that have a particular set of common features and that satisfy the needs of a particular market segment or mission. Feature modeling is one of the key activities involved in the design of SPLs. The feature diagram produced in this activity captures the commonalities and variabilities of SPLs. In some complex domains (e.g., ubiquitous computing, autonomic systems and context-aware computing), it is difficult to foresee all functionalities and variabilities a specific SPL may require. Thus, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) bind variation points at runtime to adapt to fluctuations in user needs as well as to adapt to changes in the environment. In this context, relying on formal representations of feature models is important to allow them to be automatically analyzed during system execution. Among the mechanisms used for representing and analyzing feature models, description logic (DL) based approaches demand to be better investigated in DSPLs since it provides capabilities, such as automated inconsistency detection, reasoning efficiency, scalability and expressivity. Ontology is the most common way to represent feature models knowledge based on DL reasoners. Previous works conceived ontologies for feature modeling either based on OWL classes and properties or based on OWL individuals. However, considering change or evolution scenarios of feature models, we need to compare whether a class-based or an individual-based feature modeling style is recommended to describe feature models to support SPLs, and especially its capabilities to deal with changes in feature models, as required by DSPLs. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to empirically compare two approaches based on each one of these modeling styles in several changing scenarios (e.g., add/remove mandatory feature, add/remove optional feature and so on). We measure time to perform changes, structural impact of changes (flexibility) and correctness for performing changes in our experiment. Our results indicate that using OWL individuals requires less time to change and is more flexible than using OWL classes and properties. These results provide insightful assumptions towards the definition of an approach relying on reasoning capabilities of ontologies that can effectively support products reconfiguration in the context of DSPL.},

@article{Del_Rio_Ortega:2013,
	Abstract = {A key aspect in any process-oriented organisation is the evaluation of process performance for the achievement of its strategic and operational goals. Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) are a key asset to carry out this evaluation, and, therefore, having an appropriate definition of these PPIs is crucial. After a careful review of the literature related and a study of the current picture in different real organisations, we conclude that there not exists any proposal that allows to define PPIs in a way that is unambiguous and highly expressive, understandable by technical and non-technical users and traceable with the Business Process (BP). In addition, like other activities carried out during the BP lifecycle, the management of PPIs is considered time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, providing an automated support for them is very appealing from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose the PPINOT metamodel, which allows such an advanced definition of PPIs and is independent of the language used to model the business process. Furthermore, we provide an automatic semantic mapping from the metamodel to Description Logics (DL) that allows the implementation of design-time analysis operations in such a way that DL reasoners' facilities can be leveraged. These operations provide information that can assist process analysts in the definition and instrumentation of PPIs. Finally, to validate the usefulness of our proposal, we have used the PPINOT metamodel at the core of a software tool called the PPINOT Tool Suite and we have applied it in several real scenarios.},

@article{Costa:2015,
	Abstract = {Context
Most specialized users (scientists) that use bioinformatics applications do not have suitable training on software development. Software Product Line (SPL) employs the concept of reuse considering that it is defined as a set of systems that are developed from a common set of base artifacts. In some contexts, such as in bioinformatics applications, it is advantageous to develop a collection of related software products, using SPL approach. If software products are similar enough, there is the possibility of predicting their commonalities, differences and then reuse these common features to support the development of new applications in the bioinformatics area.
Objectives
This paper presents the PL-Science approach which considers the context of SPL and ontology in order to assist scientists to define a scientific experiment, and to specify a workflow that encompasses bioinformatics applications of a given experiment. This paper also focuses on the use of ontologies to enable the use of Software Product Line in biological domains.
Method
In the context of this paper, Scientific Software Product Line (SSPL) differs from the Software Product Line due to the fact that SSPL uses an abstract scientific workflow model. This workflow is defined according to a scientific domain and using this abstract workflow model the products (scientific applications/algorithms) are instantiated.
Results
Through the use of ontology as a knowledge representation model, we can provide domain restrictions as well as add semantic aspects in order to facilitate the selection and organization of bioinformatics workflows in a Scientific Software Product Line. The use of ontologies enables not only the expression of formal restrictions but also the inferences on these restrictions, considering that a scientific domain needs a formal specification.
Conclusions
This paper presents the development of the PL-Science approach, encompassing a methodology and an infrastructure, and also presents an approach evaluation. This evaluation presents case studies in bioinformatics, which were conducted in two renowned research institutions in Brazil.},

	Abstract = {Over the last two decades, software product lines have been used successfully in industry for building families of systems of related products, maximizing reuse, and exploiting their variable and configurable options. In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures.},

	Abstract = {Context
Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the discipline of controlling the evolution of large and complex software systems. Over the years many different SCM systems sharing similar concepts have been implemented from scratch. Since these concepts usually are hard-wired into the respective program code, reuse is hardly possible.
Objective
Our objective is to create a model-driven product line for SCM systems. By explicitly describing the different concepts using models, reuse can be performed on the modeling level. Since models are executable, the need for manual programming is eliminated. Furthermore, by providing a library of loosely coupled modules, we intend to support flexible composition of SCM systems.
Method
We developed a method and a tool set for model-driven software product line engineering which we applied to the SCM domain. For domain analysis, we applied the FORM method, resulting in a layered feature model for SCM systems. Furthermore, we developed an executable object-oriented domain model which was annotated with features from the feature model. A specific SCM system is configured by selecting features from the feature model and elements of the domain model realizing these features.
Results
Due to the orthogonality of both feature model and domain model, a very large number of SCM systems may be configured. We tested our approach by creating instances of the product line which mimic wide-spread systems such as CVS, GIT, Mercurial, and Subversion.
Conclusion
The experiences gained from this project demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to model-driven software product line engineering. Furthermore, our work advances the state of the art in the domain of SCM systems since it support the modular composition of SCM systems at the model rather than the code level.},

@article{Bezerra:2017,
	Abstract = {Evaluating the quality of a feature model is essential to ensure that errors in the early stages do not spread throughout the Software Product Line (SPL). One way to evaluate the feature model is to use measures that could be associated with the feature model quality characteristics and their quality attributes. In this paper, we aim at investigating how measures can be applied to the quality assessment of SPL feature models. We performed an exploratory case study using the COfFEE maintainability measures catalog and the S.P.L.O.T. feature models repository. In order to support this case study, we built a dataset (denoted by MAcchiATO) containing the values of 32 measures from COfFEE for 218 software feature models, extracted from S.P.L.O.T. This research approach allowed us to explore three different data analysis techniques. First, we applied the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in order to identify relationships between the measures. This analysis showed that not all 32 measures in COfFEE are necessary to reveal the quality of a feature model and just 15 measures could be used. Next, the 32 measures in COfFEE were grouped by applying the Principal Component Analysis and a set of 9 new grouped measures were defined. Finally, we used the Tolerance Interval technique to define statistical thresholds for these 9 new grouped measures. So, our findings suggest that measures can be effectively used to support the quality evaluation of SPL feature models.},

A recent literature review reported that more than 30 analysis operations have been identified and different analysis mechanisms have been proposed. Product configuration is a well established research field with more than 30 years of successful applications in different industrial domains. Our hypothesis, that is not really new, is that these two independent areas of research have interesting synergies that have not been fully explored. To try to explore the potential synergies systematically, in this paper we provide a rapid review to bring together these previously disparate streams of work. We define a set of research questions and give a preliminary answer to some of them. We conclude that there are many research opportunities in the synergy of these independent areas.},

Feature models symbolize a representation of the possible application configuration space, and can be customized based on specific domain requirements and stakeholder goals. Most feature model configuration processes neglect the need to have a holistic approach towards the integration and satisfaction of the stakeholder's soft and hard constraints, and the application-domain integrity constraints. In this paper, we will show how the structure and constraints of a feature model can be modeled uniformly through Propositional Logic extended with concrete domains, called {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}P{\}}{\{}(N){\}}{\$}. Furthermore, we formalize the representation of soft constraints in fuzzy {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}P{\}}{\{}(N){\}}{\$}and explain how semi-automated feature model configuration is performed. The model configuration derivation process that we propose respects the soundness and completeness properties.},

@article{Asadi:2014a,
	Abstract = {Context
A software product line is a family of software systems that share some common features but also have significant variabilities. A feature model is a variability modeling artifact, which represents differences among software products with respect to the variability relationships among their features. Having a feature model along with a reference model developed in the domain engineering lifecycle, a concrete product of the family is derived by binding the variation points in the feature model (called configuration process) and by instantiating the reference model.
Objective
In this work we address the feature model configuration problem and propose a framework to automatically select suitable features that satisfy both the functional and non-functional preferences and constraints of stakeholders. Additionally, interdependencies between various non-functional properties are taken into account in the framework.
Method
The proposed framework combines Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) to compute the non-functional properties weights based on stakeholders' preferences and interdependencies between non-functional properties. Afterwards, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is applied to find the optimal feature model configuration.
Result
Our approach improves state-of-art of feature model configuration by considering positive or negative impacts of the features on non-functional properties, the stakeholders' preferences, and non-functional interdependencies. The approach presented in this paper extends earlier work presented in [1] from several distinct perspectives including mechanisms handling interdependencies between non-functional properties, proposing a novel tooling architecture, and offering visualization and interaction techniques for representing functional and non-functional aspects of feature models.
Conclusion
our experiments show the scalability of our configuration approach when considering both functional and non-functional requirements of stakeholders.},

	Abstract = {Configurable reference process models encompass common and variable processes of organizations from different business domains. These reference process models are designed and reused to guide and derive customized business processes according to the requirements of stakeholders. The customization process is generally initiated by a configuration step, selecting a subset of the reference process model. Configuration is followed by a customization step, which assumes adapting or extending the configured business process based on the specific or unforeseen requirements. Hence, it is crucial to validate the correctness and compliance of the final customized business process with respect to the patterns and business constraints that are specified in the reference model. In this paper, we firstly introduce a technique to develop a customized process model and then present a set of identified inconsistency patterns that may happen during the configuration of a reference model and the customization of configured process models. Furthermore, we describe our proposed approach including formal representations and algorithms that provide logical reasoning and enable automatic inconsistency detection by leveraging description logic. In order to explore the scalability of the approach, we designed the experiments with various process models sizes and inconsistency distributions. The results of the experiments revealed the scalability of our approach with large size process models (500 activities).},

	Abstract = {Formal specification and verification techniques have been used successfully to detect feature interactions. We investigate whether feature-based specifications can be used for this task. Feature-based specifications are a special class of specifications that aim at modularity in open-world, feature-oriented systems. The question we address is whether modularity of specifications impairs the ability to detect feature interactions, which cut across feature boundaries. In an exploratory study on 10 feature-oriented systems, we found that the majority of feature interactions could be detected based on feature-based specifications, but some specifications have not been modularized properly and require undesirable workarounds to modularization. Based on the study, we discuss the merits and limitations of feature-based specifications, as well as open issues and perspectives. A goal that underlies our work is to raise awareness of the importance and challenges of feature-based specification.},

Software product lines provide systematic reuse within a product family. Extended feature models with cardinalities are widely used for managing variability and commonality in the software product line domains. In this paper, we use promotion technique in Alloy to formalize constraint based extended feature models with cardinalities and their specialization and generalization. This technique has a significant influence on applying analysis operations on feature models. To show the benefits of the promotion technique, we calculate the reuse ratio of a feature in a large scale software product line.
