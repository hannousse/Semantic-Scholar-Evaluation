	Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to automatic scenario generation from environment behavior models for testing of real-time reactive systems. The model of behavior is defined as a set of events (event trace) with two basic relations: precedence and inclusion. The attributed event grammar (AEG) specifies possible event traces and provides a uniform approach for automatically generating and executing test cases. The environment model includes a description of hazardous states in which the system may arrive and makes it possible to gather statistics for system safety assessment. The approach is supported by a generator that creates test cases from the AEG models. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of a software prototype of the computer-assisted resuscitation algorithm for a safety-critical casualty intravenous fluid infusion pump.},

	Abstract = {We present a technique which generates from Abstract State Machines specifications a set of test sequences capable to uncover specific fault classes. The notion of test goal is introduced as a state predicate denoting the detection condition for a particular fault. Tests are generated by forcing a model checker to produce counter examples which cover the test goals. We introduce a technique for the evaluation of the fault detection capability of a test set. We report some experimental results which validate the method, compare the fault adequacy criteria with some classical structural coverage criteria and show an empirical cross coverage among faults.},

@inproceedings{Wilkinson:2014,
	Abstract = {We describe ongoing work into the generation of test cases for safety critical systems using Event-B and the Rodin toolset. Verification of software to DO-178C is a two stage process. First a suite of test cases must be validated against the system requirements (requirements coverage), and then the software implementation is verified using the validated test suite. During verification of the implementation structural coverage is also measured.},

@inproceedings{Gentile:2014,
	Abstract = {Model Based Testing (MBT) enables automatic generation of test cases using models to specify the system behavior and requirements. Key features of MBT approaches are the automation level and the complexity of non-automated steps. Usually, test case generation is supported by some automatic technique whereas modeling is manually performed. UML statecharts or other extended finite state machine formalisms are widely used to build behavior models. To ease their development, as well as the extraction of test cases from them, is an important aspect to be addressed in order to perform testing activities with lower skill, cost and effort. This paper aims at providing a contribution to both the issues. Test Specification Patterns (TSPs) are proposed and expressed by means of UML annotated statecharts as a mean to aid the construction of models and build specifications on the base of well known recurring problems and their solutions (patterns). In order to improve usability and increase the automation level, a transformational approach is defined which derives Promela code from specifications built by TSPs composition and applies model checking to obtain test sequences by using the SPIN model checker. The usage of TSPs and the test case generation process is illustrated on a test scenario from the Radio Block Centre, the vital core of the modern railway control systems.},
