	Abstract = {Activities that engage young children with the sensory properties of foods are popular with nursery schools, despite the lack of evidence for their efficacy in increasing children's consumption of healthy foods. This study provides the first empirical exploration of the effectiveness of a non-taste sensory activity program in a nursery school setting. Ninety-two children aged between 12 and 36 months were allocated either to an intervention group, who took part in looking, listening, feeling and smelling activities with unusual fruits and vegetables every day for 4 weeks, or to a non-intervention control group. In a subsequent mealtime taste test, children touched and tasted more of the vegetables to which they had been familiarized in their playtime activities than of a matched set of non-exposed foods. The results demonstrate that hands-on activities with unfamiliar fruits and vegetables can enhance children's willingness to taste these foods, and confirm the potential for such activities to support healthy eating initiatives.},

	Abstract = {The tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cultivation and cigarettes manufacture industries discard huge amount of waste tobacco materials that have strong nicotine smell and contaminate the environment. A high-efficient procedure was developed for simultaneously extracting nicotine and solanesol from the waste tobacco leaf vein through the column-chromatographic extraction (CCE), followed by automatically separating and simply purifying them. Dried material powder was loaded into columns and eluted with the optimal extraction solvent of petroleum ether (PE):95% alkali ethanol (4:6). Greater than 96% extraction efficiency for both nicotine and solanesol was obtained with a 2-fold excess solvent of the material (v/w) through a cyclic CCE procedure in small-scale and scaled-up experiments. The extraction solution was separated into an ethanol-aqueous phase containing 98% nicotine and an ether phase containing 96% solanesol at pH 2.0. The ethanol-aqueous phase was vacuum-concentrated to aqueous, and 99% purity nicotine was obtained by ether fractionation of the aqueous at pH 10.0. Solanesol in the ether phase was purified to 93.1% by one time silica gel column chromatography. All processes were completed at room temperature and all solvents used were completely recovered for reuse. This work provides an extensively simplified procedure to economically utilize the tobacco wastes.},

	Abstract = {Research on welfare indicators has focused primarily on indicators of poor welfare, but there is also a need for indicators that can cover the range from good to poor welfare. The aim of this experiment was to compare behaviour elements in dairy cows shown in response to a frustrative situation as well as elements shown as a response to pleasant, desirable stimuli, and in particular measure the visible percentage of white in the eyes. The subjects of the study were 24 randomly selected dairy cows, 12 in each group, all Norwegian Red Cattle. In a 6min test of hungry cows, access to food and food deprivation were used as positive and frustrating situations, respectively. The cows of the positive stimulus group were fed normally from a rectangular wooden box. When the deprived animals were introduced to the stimulus, the box had a top of Plexiglas with holes so that the cows could both see and smell the food, but were unable to reach it. All cows were habituated to the box before the experiment started. All food-deprived cows showed at least one of these behaviours: aggressiveness (the most frequent), stereotypies, vocalization, and head shaking, while these behaviour patterns were never observed among cows given food. The percentage of white of the total visible eye area was larger than normal in the food-deprived cows, gradually increasing until 4min after test starts, while it was consistently lower than normal in the cows that were fed. The percentage of white correlated positively with the number of aggressive buts in deprived cows. The results suggest that the eye white may be a dynamic indicator of emotions in dairy cattle on a frustration--contentedness axis.},

	Abstract = {Mating in the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) was examined; in particular the nature of mating and the role of sex pheromones. A semi-lunar periodicity (16.8 days and 14.5 days, respectively) was observed in the mating frequencies in two consecutive breeding seasons (2001--2002 and 2002--2003). This semi-lunar rhythm coincided with spring tides (full and new moon), and activity peaked in November. Observation of the progression of specific behaviour types in mating and non-mating pairs revealed that pairs which would go on to complete mating progressed from fighting to mating behaviour significantly faster than non-mating pairs. These findings indicate that mate recognition occurs only after physical contact. Reproductively active pairs (ascertained from mating experiments) were then used for several bioassays aiming to assess under which conditions pheromones may be released by females. Firstly, male E. sinensis were exposed to female smell in an actograph experiment and secondly, male antennule flick rate was recorded before and after exposure to the urine of a sexually active female. In both cases no change in male E. sinensis behaviour was observed. Both experiments used females which had not had immediately prior exposure to males. However, in further experiments using water where mating had occurred, a significant response in antennule flick rate was triggered. Finally, a sponge assay was used in order to test the male attraction to a sponge injected with a water sample of varying concentrations (0.5×, 1×, 3×, 4.5×, 9×) of female smell. These samples were conditioned using a female immediately following a mating attempt. Males tried to grasp the sponge at 3× increased concentrations or higher. In conclusion, this study found no indication that E. sinensis females release a distance pheromone, but instead that mate recognition occurs after physical contact between male and female, most likely via a contact pheromone.},

	Abstract = {Soil column experiments in both the saturated and unsaturated regimes are widely used for applied and theoretical studies in such diverse fields as transport model evaluation, fate and transport of pesticides, explosives, microbes, heavy metals and non aqueous phase liquids, and for evapotranspiration studies. The apparent simplicity of constructing soil columns conceals a number of technical issues which can seriously affect the outcome of an experiment, such as the presence or absence of macropores, artificial preferential flow paths, non-ideal infiltrate injection and unrealistic moisture regimes. This review examines the literature to provide an analysis of the state of the art for constructing both saturated and unsaturated soil columns. Common design challenges are discussed and best practices for potential solutions are presented. This article discusses both basic principles and the practical advantages and disadvantages of various experimental approaches. Both repacked and monolith-type columns are discussed. The information in this review will assist soil scientists, hydrogeologists and environmental professionals in optimizing the construction and operation of soil column experiments in order to achieve their objectives, while avoiding serious design flaws which can compromise the integrity of their results.},

@article{BAVOTA20151,
	Abstract = {Previous studies have investigated the reasons behind refactoring operations performed by developers, and proposed methods and tools to recommend refactorings based on quality metric profiles, or on the presence of poor design and implementation choices, i.e., code smells. Nevertheless, the existing literature lacks observations about the relations between metrics/code smells and refactoring activities performed by developers. In other words, the characteristics of code components increasing/decreasing their chances of being object of refactoring operations are still unknown. This paper aims at bridging this gap. Specifically, we mined the evolution history of three Java open source projects to investigate whether refactoring activities occur on code components for which certain indicators---such as quality metrics or the presence of smells as detected by tools---suggest there might be need for refactoring operations. Results indicate that, more often than not, quality metrics do not show a clear relationship with refactoring. In other words, refactoring operations are generally focused on code components for which quality metrics do not suggest there might be need for refactoring operations. Finally, 42% of refactoring operations are performed on code entities affected by code smells. However, only 7% of the performed operations actually remove the code smells from the affected class.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a technique, called smell-driven performance analysis (SDPA), which automatically provides situated explanations within a visual dataflow language IDE to help end-user programmers to overcome performance problems without leaving the visual dataflow paradigm. An experiment showed SDPA increased end-user programmers' success rates at finding performance problems and decreased the time required for finding solutions. Another study, based on using SDPA to analyze a corpus of example end-user programs, revealed that it is usually accurate at identifying performance problems. Based on these results, we conclude that SDPA provides a reliable basis for helping end-user programmers to troubleshoot performance problems, as well as a potential foundation for future work aimed at training users and at aiding code reuse.},

@article{MCGREGOR20021,
	Abstract = {The behavioural responses to two commonly used `predator odours' were assessed in male Wistar rats. Cat odour was presented to rats in the form of a piece of collar that had been worn by a domestic cat. Fox odour was presented in an equivalent piece of (unworn) collar that had been impregnated with 2,4,5 Trimethylthiazoline (TMT)---an extract of fox faeces. Other rats were exposed to collars containing Triethylamine (TEA), a putrid fishy smell, or formaldehyde, which has an acrid irritating smell. Experiment 1 showed that rats approached cat odour, TMT and TEA significantly less than they did an unworn collar. However, only cat odour increased retreat to the hide box, reduced locomotor activity and elicited `head out' behaviour. When tested immediately after odour exposure, only cat odour exposed rats showed increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze and suppressed activity in a 90-min general activity test. When returned to the odour-paired environment 24 h later in the absence of test odours, only rats that had previously received cat odour showed evidence of conditioned fear. Experiment 2 showed that rats given the benzodiazepine drug midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) display increased approach and decreased defensiveness towards a cat odour impregnated collar. In contrast, midazolam accentuated the avoidance of TMT and formaldehyde containing collars. Experiment 3 showed that when cat odour was presented in a small, enclosed environment, rats display increased body immobility, decreased grooming and increased orientation towards the odour-exuding stimulus. These responses were not seen with TMT or TEA containing collars. Taken together, these results suggest that while cat odour strongly elicits specific defensive behaviours in rats, TMT has effects that are more characteristic of an aversive odour. We suggest that the results of some previous studies using TMT may need to be reassessed.},

	Abstract = {Java access modifiers regulate interactions among software components. In particular, class modifiers specify which classes from a component are publicly exposed and therefore belong to the component public interface. Restricting the accessibility as specified by a programmer is key to ensure a proper software modularity. It has been said that failing to do so is likely to produce maintenance problems, poor system quality, and architecture decay. However, how developers uses class access modifiers or how inadequate access modifiers affect software systems has not been investigated yet in the literature. In this work, we empirically analyze the use of class access modifiers across a collection of 15 Java libraries and 15 applications, totaling over 3.6M lines of code. We have found that an average of 25% of classes are over-exposed, i.e., classes defined with an accessibility that is broader than necessary. A number of code patterns involving over-exposed classes have been formalized, characterizing programmers׳ habits. Furthermore, we propose an Eclipse plugin to make component public interfaces match with the programmer׳s intent.},

	Abstract = {Even though object oriented software development has gained popularity due to its inherent features, it also throws challenges in early detection of defects during design phase. Detection of design defects helps in performing appropriate refactorings in improving the quality of design. Literature indicates that active research is going on in detecting design defects using metrics. The present paper introduces a set of metrics for detecting defects in object oriented designs caused by the presence of shotgun surgery and divergent change bad smells. These metrics are, dependency oriented complexity metric for structure (DOCMS(R)), dependen-cy oriented complexity metric for an artifact causing ripples (DOCMA(CR)), and dependency oriented complexity metric for an artifact affected by ripples (DOCMA(AR)). The proposed me-trics have been computed for four cases. These metrics are used successfully in detecting design defects and complexity. In the present study DOCMA(CR) metric value indicated the presence of shotgun surgery bad smell, whereas DOCMA(AR) metric value indicated the presence of divergent change bad smell. DOCMS(R) metric value indicated the increase in complexity of structure (ar-chitecture) when the design defects are present. Detecting bad smells helps in performing appropriate refactorings to make the software maintainable and to improve the quality of software.},

	Abstract = {To assist maintenance and evolution teams, work needs to be done at the onset of software development. One such facilitation is refactoring the code, making it easier to read, understand and maintain. Refactoring is done by identifying bad smell areas in the code. In this paper, based on empirical analysis, we develop a metrics model to identify smelly classes. The role of two new metrics (encapsulation and information hiding) is also investigated for identifying smelly and faulty classes in software code. This paper first presents a binary statistical analysis of thev relationship between metrics and bad smells, the results of which show a significant relationship. Then, the metrics model (with significant metrics shortlisted from the binary analysis) for bad smell categorization (divided into five categories) is developed. To verify our model, we examine the open source Firefox system, which has a strong industrial usage. The results show that proposed metrics model for bad smell can predict faulty classes with high accuracy, but in the case of the categorized model not all categories of bad smells can adequately identified the faulty and smelly classes. Due to certain limitations of our study more experiments are required to generalize the results of bad smell and faulty class identification in software code.},

	Abstract = {The main aim of this pilot study is to investigate management anti-patterns encountered in IT innovation projects, in the long run. A quantitative research methodology was chosen. A group of software project managers in industrial innovation projects were requested to fill in a questionnaire. The collected data revealed anti-patterns, which were compared and contrasted to the anti-patterns mostly found in traditional software projects. Some anti-patterns encountered in conventional software projects were also identified in innovation projects. Additionally, a new possible anti-pattern was identified and further investigated. The new anti-pattern regards the management of team creativity and is considered as an anti-pattern, because it can be an obstacle in teamwork progress, having negative consequences. A remedy solution is recommended as a re-factoring and recovering management strategy. Overall, this pilot study offers a set of practical guidelines for project managers, and innovation project managers in particular; this is a current IT management need that must be addressed in the near future. Further, there is a gap of relevant knowledge in the field and there are no similar studies regarding software project management anti-patterns in innovation projects in the literature. Therefore, this work could be considered as the first ever pilot research study, which investigates and reports on anti-patterns in innovation projects. Finally, we mention our future plans and outline how this initial data gathering can be useful for constructing a research project to find out more on the above research needs and IT development metarequirements.},

	Abstract = {Human beings possess six highly efficient sensory system such as vision, hearing, touch, taste and smell. Many of these sensory systems are artificially replicated to provide intelligence to the machines. This paper reviews the various techniques and instruments that can be used to design a human olfactory system, which can be used in different applications. The odour detection systems can be broadly classified into four categories such as gas sensors, bio-sensors, gas chromatography systems and hybrid systems. Other common odour detection instruments like electronic noses (E-noses), mass spectrometers (MS), differential optical absorption spectrometers (DOAS) are also reviewed in this paper. The selection of any odour detection technique is influenced by several factors like on-field deployability, odour detection and classification capabilities, sensitivity of the instruments and sensitivity of the instruments to the air matrices. Among all the possible detection methods, Electronic nose is having advanced capabilities as compared to other instruments. The presence of interference noise act as a major hindrance for the efficiency of the odour detection devices. Integration of gas chromatography along with interference filters can provide an increased accuracy in the odour detection.},

A three Degree-Of-Freedom (3DOF) computer controlled simulator with special effects is designed, implemented, and tested. The simulator platform moves in response to control signals generated by a three-dimensional (3D) virtual gaming environment. In order to add more reality to the gaming environment, external effects, that represent a fourth dimension to virtual environment, are added to the simulator environment such as smell, sound, light, and sense of temperature (heat or cold) that are synchronized with the events happening in the 3D virtual gaming environment. The controlled simulator is developed for entertainment purposes and to suit all ages. The proposed system was tested and verified in the sense that the platform interacts with all events occur in the 3D virtual environment and external effects. The proposed 4D entertainment machine can be used in amusement parks and family entertainment centers and malls.},

Our group have developed an olfactory display using electroosmotic (EO) pumps and a surface acoustic device (SAW) device. In this study, the improved olfactory display is described. The number of odor components was increased from 6 in the previous work to 8 whereas the size was further miniaturized so that it can be equipped on a headset. A visual-olfactory display system was also developed using the proposed olfactory display. The system can release scents in accordance with contents in the movie on Windows Media Player platform run on a PC. An experiment based on sensory test was performed to evaluate the capability to release scents of low volatile odorants within a short time and without odor remaining after the presentation.},

	Abstract = {Recently, the concept of adding multisensory media components to complement and extend user Quality of Experience (QoE) of traditional media has gained attention from both academia and industry. Research works stimulating additional senses like olfaction (sense of smell), haptic (sense of touch) and gustation (sense of taste) have emerged. In particular in theme parks, multisensory experiences that also offer ambient lighting effects, vibrating seats, wind generators, mist effects, heaters/coolers, etc. are appearing. Considering this growing awareness and popularity, a key research challenge is to experimentally evaluate if and how these different effects affect user QoE. In this context, there is a lack of common test content and raw data results to support reproducible research and cross research team verification. This paper fills this gap. We share: the data from the empirical study; the video content; the olfactory components employed to enrich the video; the methodologies employed and various other aspects found through experience to be important. Uniquely, this work is complemented by two datasets, obtained in two separate but related empirical studies, one conducted in the UK, and the other in Ireland.},

	Abstract = {Given more efficient utilization of waste, the social impact of waste recycling is far-reaching in saving resources and reducing environmental pollution, therefore promoting society development. The sources of waste edible oil are very complicated. The color of waste oil after simple recycling and refining is still dark and with strong smell. The amount of a variety of impurities is relatively huge. The pigment in waste oil affects its stability, industrial use and further processing. In order to meet the requirements of comprehensive utilization of waste oil, pre-decoloration is absolutely necessary. Activate clay has been reported to have decoloration effect on waste edible oil and this paper discussed the factors which influenced the decoloration rate. The optimum conditions of decoloration were established in this research: concentration of activated clay was 5%; initial temperature of decoloration was 60degC; final temperature of decoloration was 120degC and time of decoloration was 25 min. This result of research could provide appropriate material for the utilization of waste edible oil in production of detergent by saponification, save the natural resources and economy cost. At the same time, the "waste" became "available resources".},

	Abstract = {``Code Smell'' or ``Bad Smell'', at the very least, is an indicator of badly for source code and is often analytical of deeper problems in software design. In layman terms, it signals flaws in the core foundation or architecture of the software that can cause any number of more serious problems - from usability and runtime performance to supportability and enhancement. These problems can mostly be prevented by the systematic refactoring of the code. Code smells are symptoms of deep-rooted problems in design, which, in most common cases, reduce the understandability of the system for present and future programmers, therefore depiction the program un-maintainable. Identification of these code smells has been thought of as an spontaneous art rather than an exact science, as there are very few empirical measures or methodologies for doing so. This paper implements JSmell, which will follow a scientific approach to detect five of these 22 code smells. JSmell will give suggestions to refactor the code for all five of these smells. Further, the tool will provide an interactive process to refactor two of these cases; while for the rest, it will suggest an ideal refactoring technique that would need to be applied manually.},

In this article, a model of coordinating degree of environment-economy compound system is set up; based on an empirical study of the Xi'an region, the supporting mechanism of the coordinated development of environment and economy is constructed with multi-disciplinary theory. It is found that regional economy in west China is expanding quickly, but the emphasis on environmental protection is far from enough, resulting in the weakening of the coordinating relationship. There is a keen need to make modifications to macro policy-making so as to put an end to the disharmony between environment and economic development. In view of the fact that the environmental interests are in a disadvantageous position as compared with immediate economic benefits, the author suggests that environmental protection should be given the priority in policy-making; only a reasonable policy, sound operating mechanism and economical environmental culture can ensure the coordinated development of environment and economy.},

Our approach that addresses design patterns can be an excellent alternative to current systems such as OO metric, software fault proneness, visualization and anti-pattern based approaches. Our approach also can be helpful to practitioners for software quality assurance.},

To remove automatically long method bad smell, which is one of the most serious bad smells, we need an automatic application of six refactoring techniques. However, only one refactoring technique ``Extract Method'' can be automated. In this research, we propose an algorithm to identify code locations which will be extracted for creating a query method. We performed an experiment to conclude the workability and correctness of our algorithm. This is the most important step towards an automatic application of refactoring technique ``replace temp with query''.},

	Abstract = {Bad smells help us to look deeper into the problem as they are threat to design principles and quality of software. Redesigning helps us in restructuring code without any change in its external behavior. It is not feasible to restructure each class of the software due release time constraints. Therefore, there is a need to prioritize classes so that effort and quality can be improved. In this study, we have proposed a framework based on the combination of C & K metric suite and eleven types of bad smells. A new metric, Quality Decline Factor (QDF), has been proposed which identify the severity of the classes and helps the software maintenance team to focus only on severely affected code. Pareto analysis is also valid in this study which states that 80% of the code quality can be improved by providing redesigning treatments to 20% of the severely affected code. This study will reduce the work of software maintenance practitioners and will help them to complete their work on time.},

	Abstract = {Method placement is one of the most important design activities in any object oriented application. Recommendation of move method refactorings plays a significant role through grouping similar behavior of methods. It is also used as a refactoring technique of feature envy code smell by placing methods into correct classes from the incorrect ones. Due to this code smell, an application will be tightly coupled and loosely cohesive which reflect poor design and hence development and maintenance effort, time and cost will be increased. Existing techniques mostly used only non-static methods for refactoring the code smell and so these approaches are not generalized for all types of methods (static and non-static). This paper proposes a novel approach for recommending move method refactorings to remove the code smell for both types of methods based on coupling, cohesion and context. The results of a preliminary empirical evaluation indicate that the proposed approach provides better results than JDeodorant (a popular eclipse plugin for refactorings).},

They are facing serious health issues because water pollution and foul smell. It is a burning issue in Aurangabad city since last year. It is very critical task to identify new sites using traditional way for dumping of solid waste. A rule based identification of new site can be done using a Remote Sensing and GIS, which can save time and increase accuracy. For that purpose a required data was collected from the Survey of India and NRSC Hyderabad. A Spatial feature extraction was done using for Reserved Forest area, Water bodies, Canals, drainage Network, Road and Railway Network. Rasterization processes were applied on Toposheet to extract Settlement area. For every spatial feature a Buffer Zone was created as per guideline given by the Ministry of Environment, GOI. After this process a one by one Overlay Analysis was performed. Seven sites which follow the guidelines and having more than 100 Acres area were selected for Field visit. In Field visit Geographic coordinates were taken using GPS enabled Smartphone with `My GPS Coordinates' android application having accuracy of 4 meter and verified these sites on Google Earth also. On the basis of field visit three sites are proposed as most suitable sites for dumping of solid waste. In this work we have tried to give solution to local decision makers regarding this issue.},

Realistic media contents are media with multiple sensorial effects (mulsemedia) aimed at increasing user's experience through the five sense representation (i.e., taste, sight, touch, smell, and hearing). In this research area, a key issue is the measure of the impact of mulsemedia on the perceived user's quality of experience (QoE). This paper provides an updated overview of the researches achieved in the domain of QoE for mulsemedia services. Results are summarized based on subjective quality assessments for audiovisual sequences enriched with effects, such as ambient light, wind and vibration effects. This paper aims at providing the broadcasting community with a survey to understand the role that mulsemedia could play in the QoE enhancement in future broadcasting services.

	Abstract = {Nowadays, cloud computing is an emerging technology thanks to its ability to provide on-demand computing services (hardware and software) with less description standardization effort. Multiple issues and challenges in discovering cloud services appear due to the lack of the cloud service description standardization. In fact, the existing cloud providers describe, their similar offered services in different ways. Thus, various existing works aim at standardizing the representation of cloud computing services while proposing ontologies. However, since the existing proposals were not evaluated, they might be less adopted and considered. Indeed, the ontology evaluation has a direct impact on its understandability and reusability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to validate our proposed Cloud Service Ontology (CSO), to guarantee an adequate cloud service discovery. This paper contribution is threefold. First, it specifies a set of patterns and anti-patterns in order to evaluate CSO. Second, it defines an anti-pattern detection method based on SPARQL queries which provides a set of correction recommendations to help ontologists revise the ontology. Finally, some experiment tests were conducted in relation to: (i) the method efficiency and (ii) anti-pattern detection of design anomalies as well as taxonomic and domain errors within CSO.},

Thus, the detection of bad smells has drawn the attention of many researchers and practitioners. Quite a few approaches have been proposed to detect code bad smells. Most approaches are solely based on structural information extracted from source code. However, we have observed that some code bad smells have the evolutionary property, and thus propose a novel approach to detect three code bad smells by mining software evolutionary data: duplicated code, shotgun surgery, and divergent change. It exploits association rules mined from change history of software systems, upon which we define heuristic algorithms to detect the three bad smells. The experimental results on five open source projects demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher precision, recall and F-measure.},

	Abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming applications have led to the disharmony among the involved parties: Content Service Providers (CSPs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and P2P streaming End-Users (EUs). This disharmony is not only a technical problem at the network aspect, but also an economic problem at the business aspect. To handle this tussle, this paper proposes a profitable business model to enable all involved parties to enlarge their benefits with the help of a novel QoS-based architecture integrated with caching techniques. We model the interactions, including competition and innovation, among CSPs, ISPs and EUs as a tripartite game by introducing a pricing scheme, which captures both network and business aspects of the P2P streaming applications. We study the tripartite game in different market scenarios as more and more ISPs and CSPs involve into the market. A three-stage Stackelberg game combining with Cournot game is proposed to study the interdependent, interactive and competitive relationship among CSPs, ISPs and EUs. Moreover, we investigate how the market competition motivates ISPs to upgrade the cache service infrastructure. Our theoretical analysis and empirical study both show that the tripartite game can result in a win-win-win outcome. The market competition plays an important role in curbing the pricing power of CSPs and ISPs, and this effect is more remarkable when the amounts of CSPs and ISPs become infinite. Interestingly, we find that in the tripartite game there exists a longstop at which ISPs may have no incentive to upgrade the cache service infrastructure. However, increasing the market competition level can propel the innovation of ISPs.},

	Abstract = {Recently, block-based programming languages like Alice, Scratch and Blockly have become popular tools for programming education. There is substantial research showing that block-based languages are suitable for early programming education. But can block-based programs be smelly too? And does that matter to learners? In this paper we explore the code smells metaphor in the context of block-based programming language Scratch. We conduct a controlled experiment with 61 novice Scratch programmers, in which we divided the novices into three groups. One third receive a non-smelly program, while the other groups receive a program suffering from the Duplication or the Long Method smell respectively. All subjects then perform the same comprehension tasks on their program, after which we measure their time and correctness. The results of the experiment show that code smell indeed influence performance: subjects working on the program exhibiting code smells perform significantly worse, but the smells did not affect the time subjects needed. Investigating different types of tasks in more detail, we find that Long Method mainly decreases system understanding, while Duplication decreases the ease with which subjects modify Scratch programs.},

	Abstract = {Standard Development Organizations (SDOs) have one thing in common: they uniformly refrain from formally defining the meaning of "Fair, Reasonable and Non- Discriminatory" (FRAND) licensing terms required for patents essential to implement technical standards, called standardessential patents (SEPs). This uniformity in non-definition is called FRAND Harmony. However, in a bitterly contested and controversial move, the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) amended its patent policy, effective March 15, 2015, to become the only major SDO to substantively define FRAND licensing terms, a definition at great variance with other SDOs' practice and a substantial deviation from IEEE's traditional neutrality on FRAND terms. IEEE's new departure from de facto industry standard licensing practice will put parties into irreconcilable legal positions: SEP licenses for new standards may not simultaneously conform to the new FRAND terms mandated by the 2015 IEEE patent policy, and to legacy FRAND terms in the old licenses that necessarily follows legacy technology. This will undermine dynamic efficiencies in innovation where new standards incorporate other legacy standards by reference as "normative," and where standard amendments are rolled-up into new revisions of the standard. Under this new patent policy, IEEE Societies will be handicapped in developing new standards that build on legacy standards. IEEE's deviation from FRAND Harmony has the additional potential of inducing a practice that would discriminate among SEP holders in adopting technologies in IEEE standards. Many top quality and complex standards projects may grind to a halt unless IEEE-SA reverses course, as another SDO did two decades ago when their similar experiment with FRAND disharmony failed.},

	Abstract = {Regression testing is a core activity that allows developers to ensure that source code changes do not introduce bugs. An important prerequisite then is that test cases are deterministic. However, this is not always the case as some tests suffer from socalled flakiness. Flaky tests have serious consequences, as they can hide real bugs and increase software inspection costs. Existing research has focused on understanding the root causes of test flakiness and devising techniques to automatically fix flaky tests; a key area of investigation being concurrency. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between flaky tests and three previously defined test smells, namely Resource Optimism, Indirect Testing and Test Run War.We have set up a study involving 19,532 JUnit test methods belonging to 18 software systems. A key result of our investigation is that 54% of tests that are flaky contain a test code smell that can cause the flakiness. Moreover, we found that refactoring the test smells not only removed the design flaws, but also fixed all 54% of flaky tests causally co-occurring with test smells.},

	Abstract = {Context
Bereaved family members witnessing a patient's death rattle often experience distress. However, the benefits of specific care measures aimed at decreasing death rattle-associated family distress have not yet been evaluated.
Objectives
To clarify death rattle-related emotional distress levels among family members and their perceptions of the need for death rattle care improvement and explore the factors influencing both these issues.
Methods
A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of bereaved family members of cancer patients was conducted in 95 palliative care units in June 2007.
Results
Six hundred sixty-three questionnaires were mailed out, and 390 (61%) responses were analyzed. Among these, 181 (46%) respondents experienced death rattle. Of these, 66% reported high distress levels and 53% perceived a strong need for improved death rattle care. Factors influencing high distress levels were the gender (female) of family members, unawareness about death rattle being a natural phenomenon, and their fear and distressing interpretations of death rattle. Factors influencing perceptions of a strong need for improved care were the gender (male) of family members, severity of death rattle, death rattle-associated discomfort to patients, family members' experiences of inadequate nursing care (e.g., repositioning) and insufficient consultation about suctioning, and their perception of uncomfortable smells.
Conclusion
To decrease family-perceived distress, medical staff should alleviate patient symptoms and suffering with a comprehensive care strategy, try to decrease uncomfortable smells, and communicate with family members to address distressing interpretations and fears.},

	Abstract = {The information we acquire in real life gives us a holistic experience that fully incorporates a variety of sensations and bodily motions such as seeing, hearing, speaking, touching, smelling, tasting, and moving. However, the sensory modalities that can be transmitted in our information space are usually limited to visual and auditory ones. Haptic information is rarely used in the information space in our daily lives except in the case of warnings or alerts such as cellphone vibrations. Embodied media such as virtual reality and telexistence should provide holistic sensations, i.e., integrating visual, auditory, haptic, palatal, olfactory, and kinesthetic sensations, such that human users feel that they are present in a computer-generated virtual information space or a remote space having an alternate presence in the environment. Haptics plays an important role in embodied media because it provides both proprioception and cutaneous sensations; it lets users feel like they are touching distant people and objects and also lets them ``touch'' artificial objects as they see them. In this keynote, an embodied media, which extends human experiences, is overviewed and our research on an embodied media that is both visible and tangible based on our proposed theory of haptic primary colors is introduced. The embodied media would enable telecommunication, tele-experience, and pseudo-experience providing sensations such that the user would feel like working in a natural environment. It would also enable humans to engage in creative activities such as design and creation as though they were in the real environment. We have succeeded in transmitting fine haptic sensations, such as material texture and temperature, from an avatar robot's fingers to a human user's fingers. The avatar robot is a telexistence anthropomorphic robot, called TELESAR V, with a body and limbs with 53 degrees of freedom. This robot can transmit not only visual and auditory sensations of presence to human users but also realistic haptic sensations. Our other inventions include RePro3D, which is a full-parallax autostereoscopic 3D (three-dimensional) display with haptic feedback using RPT (retroreflective projection technology); TECHTILE Toolkit, which is a prototyping tool for the design and improvement of haptic media; and HaptoMIRAGE, which is an 180$\,^{\circ}$-field-of-view autostereoscopic 3D display using ARIA (active-shuttered real image autostereoscopy) that can be used by three users simultaneously.},

We earlier proposed a technique to prioritize code smells by leveraging the context of the developers, i.e., the modules that the developers plan to implement. Our empirical studies revealed that the results of code smells prioritized using our technique are useful to support developers' implementation on the modules they intend to change. Nonetheless, in software change processes, developers often navigate through many modules and refer to them before making actual changes. Such modules are important when considering the developers' context. Therefore, it is essential to ascertain whether our technique can also support developers on modules to which they are going to refer to make changes. We conducted an empirical study of an open source project adopting tools for recording developers' interaction history. Our results demonstrate that the code smells prioritized using our approach can also be used to support developers for modules to which developers are going to refer, irrespective of the need for modification.},

	Abstract = {Highly-configurable software systems (also called software product lines) gain momentum in both, academia and industry. For instance, the Linux kernel comes with over 12 000 configuration options and thus, can be customized to run on nearly every kind of system. To a large degree, this configurability is achieved through variable code structures, for instance, using conditional compilation. Such source code variability adds a new dimension of complexity, thus giving rise to new possibilities for design flaws. Code smells are an established concept to describe design flaws or decay in source code. However, existing smells have no notion of variability and thus do not support flaws regarding variable code structures. In this paper, we propose an initial catalog of four variability-aware code smells. We discuss the appearance and negative effects of these smells and present code examples from real-world systems. To evaluate our catalog, we have conducted a survey amongst 15 researchers from the field of software product lines. The results confirm that our proposed smells (a) have been observed in existing product lines and (b) are considered to be problematic for common software development activities, such as program comprehension, maintenance, and evolution.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the most common reasons that persons seek medical care.1 CRS may originate from or be perpetuated by local or systemic factors predisposing to sinus ostial obstruction and infection. These factors include anatomic or inflammatory factors leading to sinus ostial narrowing, disturbances in mucociliary transport, and subsequent infection. CRS is diagnosed by various symptoms (lasting for at least 12 weeks), which include long-term nasal congestion, thick mucus production, loss of sense of smell, sinus pressure, and facial pain, as well as physical and radiographic evidence of mucosal swelling. The goal of medical management is to reduce the swelling and inflammation, especially of the ostia, and promote drainage and a more normal nasal environment. The medical treatment should include empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with adjunctive therapy, including nasal and oral steroids, decongestants, expectorants, and saline nasal irrigation. If symptoms improve after four weeks of treatment initiation, it is recommended that the nasal steroid sprays and nasal saline irrigations should continue for at least three months. If symptoms do not improve and there is still presence of CRS signs and symptoms, the patient should be referred to an appropriate specialist for further management.},

	Abstract = {Test smells have been defined as poorly designed tests and, as reported by recent empirical studies, their presence may negatively affect comprehension and maintenance of test suites. Despite this, there are no available automated tools to support identification and repair of test smells. In this paper, we firstly investigate developers' perception of test smells in a study with 19 participants. The results show that developers generally do not recognize (potentially harmful) test smells, highlighting that automated tools for identifying such smells are much needed. However, to build effective tools, deeper insights into the test smells phenomenon are required. To this aim, we conducted a large-scale empirical investigation aimed at analyzing (i) when test smells occur in source code, (ii) what their survivability is, and (iii) whether their presence is associated with the presence of design problems in production code (code smells). The results indicate that test smells are usually introduced when the corresponding test code is committed in the repository for the first time, and they tend to remain in a system for a long time. Moreover, we found various unexpected relationships between test and code smells.

	Abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons introduced a novel technology that enables devices to advertise their presence in an area by constantly broadcasting a static unique identifier. The aim was to enhance services with location and context awareness. Although the hardware components of typical BLE Beacons systems are able to support adequate cryptography, the design and implementation of most publicly available BLE Beacon protocols appears to render them vulnerable to a plethora of attacks. Indeed, in this paper, we were able to perform user tracking, user behavior monitoring, spoofing as well as denial of service (DoS) of many supported services. Our aim is to show that these attacks stem from design flaws of the underlying protocols and assumptions made for the BLE beacons protocols. Using a clearly defined threat model, we provide a formal analysis of the adversarial capabilities and requirements and the attack impact on security and privacy for the end-user. Contrary to popular belief, BLE technology can be exploited even by low-skilled adversaries leading to exposure of user information. To demonstrate our attacks in practice, we selected Apple's iBeacon technology, as a case study. However, our analysis can be easily generalized to other BLE Beacon technologies.},

Developer inspection is required to determine if an ASA alert is important enough to fix, or an actionable alert. Supplementing current ASA tools with automated identification of actionable alerts could reduce developer inspection overhead, leading to an increase in industry adoption of ASA tools. The goal of this research is to inform the selection of an actionable alert identification technique for ranking the output of automated static analysis through a comparative evaluation of actionable alert identification techniques. We investigated six actionable alert identification techniques on three subject projects. Among these six techniques, the systematic actionable alert identification (SAAI) technique reported an average accuracy of 82.5% across the three subject projects when considering both ASA tools evaluated. Check 'n' Crash reported an average accuracy of 85.8% for the single ASA tool evaluated. The other actionable alert identification techniques had average accuracies ranging from 42.2%-78.2%.},

	Abstract = {Code smells are characteristics of software that indicate that code may have a design problem. Code smells have been proposed as a way for programmers to recognize the need for restructuring their software. Because code smells can go unnoticed while programmers are working, tools called smell detectors have been developed to alert programmers to the presence of smells in their code, and to help them understand the cause of those smells. In this paper, we propose a novel smell detector called Stench Blossom that provides an interactive ambient visualization designed to first give programmers a quick, high-level overview of the smells in their code, and then, if they wish, to help in understanding the sources of those code smells. We also describe a laboratory experiment with 12 programmers that tests several hypotheses about our tool. Our findings suggest that programmers can use our tool effectively to identify smells and to make refactoring judgements. This is partly because the tool serves as a memory aid, and partly because it is more reliable and easier to use than heuristics for analyzing smells.},

This is the reason why in the last decade several automatic unit test generation tools have been proposed, focusing particularly on high code coverage. Despite the effort spent by the research community, there is still a lack of empirical investigation aimed at analyzing the characteristics of the produced test code. Indeed, while some studies inspected the effectiveness and the usability of these tools in practice, it is still unknown whether test code is maintainable. In this paper, we conducted a large scale empirical study in order to analyze the diffusion of bad design solutions, namely test smells, in automatically generated unit test classes. Results of the study show the high diffusion of test smells as well as the frequent co-occurrence of different types of design problems. Finally we found that all test smells have strong positive correlation with structural characteristics of the systems such as size or number of classes.},

	Abstract = {Developers often have to locate design problems in the source code. Several types of design problem may manifest as code smells in the program. A code smell is a source code structure that may reveal a partial hint about the manifestation of a design problem. Recent studies suggest that developers should ignore smells occurring in isolation in a program location. Instead, they should focus on analyzing stinkier code, i.e. program locations - e.g., a class or a hierarchy - affected by multiple smells. The stinkier a program location is, more likely it contains a design problem. However, there is limited understanding if developers can effectively identify a design problem in stinkier code. Developers may struggle to make a meaning out of inter-related smells affecting the same program location. To address this matter, we applied a mixed-method approach to analyze if and how developers can effectively find design problems when reflecting upon stinky code - i.e., a program location affected by multiple smells. We performed an experiment and an interview with 11 professionals. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed that only 36.36% of the developers found more design problems when explicitly reasoning about multiple smells as compared to single smells. On the other hand, 63.63% of the developers reported much lesser false positives. Developers reported that analyses of stinky code scattered in class hierarchies or packages is often difficult, time consuming, and requires proper visualization support. Moreover, it remains time-consuming to discard stinky program locations that do not represent design problems.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports two attacks on Undercover, a human authentication scheme against passive observers proposed at CHI 2008. The first attack exploits nonuniform human behavior in responding to authentication challenges and the second one is based on information leaked from authentication challenges or responses visible to the attacker. The second attack can be generalized to break two alternative Undercover designs presented at Pervasive 2009. All the attacks exploit design flaws of the Undercover implementations.
Theoretical and experimental analyses show that both attacks can reveal the user's password with high probability with O(10) observed login sessions. Both attacks were verified by using the login data collected in a user study with 28 participants. We also propose some enhancements to make Undercover secure against the attacks reported in this paper.
Our research in breaking and improving Undercover leads to two broader implications. First, it reemphasizes the principle of "devil is in details" for the design of security-related human-computer interface. Secondly, it reveals a subtle relationship between security and usability: human users may behave in an insecure way to compromise the security of a system. To design a secure human-computer interface, designers should pay special attention to possible negative influence of any detail of the interface including how human users interact with the system.},

	Abstract = {Access control is a critical feature of many systems, including networks of services, processes within a computer, and objects within a running process. The security consequences of a particular architecture or access control policy are often difficult to determine, especially where some components are not under our control, where components are created dynamically, or where access policies are updated dynamically.
The SERSCIS Access Modeller (SAM) takes a model of a system and explores how access can propagate through it. It can both prove defined safety properties and discover unwanted properties. By defining expected behaviours, recording the results as a baseline, and then introducing untrusted actors, SAM can discover a wide variety of design flaws.
SAM is designed to handle dynamic systems (i.e., at runtime, new objects are created and access policies modified) and systems where some objects are not trusted. It extends previous approaches such as Scollar and Authodox to provide a programmer-friendly syntax for specifying behaviour, and allows modelling of services with mutually suspicious clients.
Taking the Confused Deputy example from Authodox we show that SAM detects the attack automatically; using a web-based backup service, we show how to model RBAC systems, detecting a missing validation check; and using a proxy certificate system, we show how to extend it to model new access mechanisms. On discovering that a library fails to follow an RFC precisely, we re-evaluate our existing models under the new assumption and discover that the proxy certificate design is not safe with this library.},

	Abstract = {Code annotations are the core of the main APIs and frameworks for enterprise development, and are widely used on several applications. However, despite these APIs and frameworks made advanced uses of annotations, the language API for annotation reading is far from their needs. In particular, annotation reading is still a relatively complex task, that can consume a lot of development time and that can couple the framework internal structure to its annotations. This paper proposes an annotation-based API to retrieve metadata from code annotations and populate an instance with meta-information ready to be used by the framework. The proposed API is based on best practices and approaches for metadata definition documented on patterns, and has been implemented by a framework named Esfinge Metadata. We evaluated the approach by refactoring an existing framework to use it through Esfinge Metadata. The original and the refactored versions are compared using several code assessment techniques, such as software metrics, and bad smells detection, followed by a qualitative analysis based on source code inspection. As a result, the case study revealed that the usage of the proposed API can reduce the coupling between the metadata reading code and the annotations.},

To guide the use of these metrics in the evaluation of the quality of software systems, it is important to define their thresholds. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the thresholds in the evaluation of the quality of object oriented software. To do that, we used a threshold catalog of 18 software metrics derived from 100 software systems to define detection strategies for five bad smells. They are: Large Class, Long Method, Data Class, Feature Envy and Refused Bequest. We investigate the effectiveness of the thresholds in detection analysis of 12 software systems using these strategies. The results obtained by the proposed strategies were compared with the results obtained by the tools JDeodorant and JSPiRIT, used to identify bad smells. This study shows that the metric thresholds were significantly effective in supporting the detection of bad smells.},

	Abstract = {Visual perception is becoming increasingly important in computer graphics. Research on human visual perception has led to the development of perception-driven computer graphics techniques, where knowledge of the human visual system (HVS) and, in particular, its weaknesses are exploited when rendering and displaying 3D graphics. Findings on limitations of the HVS have been used to maintain high perceived quality but reduce the computed quality of some of the image without this quality difference being perceived. This article investigates the amount of time for which (if at all) such limitations could be exploited in the presence of smell. The results show that for our experiment, adaptation to smell does indeed affect participants' ability to determine quality difference in the animations. Having been exposed to a smell before undertaking the experiment, participants were able to determine the quality in a similar fashion to the ``no smell'' condition, whereas without adaptation, participants were not able to distinguish the quality difference.},

	Abstract = {Code smells represent design situations that can affect the maintenance and evolution of software. They make the system difficult to evolve. Code smells are detected, in general, using quality metrics that represent some symptoms. However, the selection of suitable quality metrics is challenging due to the absence of consensus in identifying some code smells based on a set of symptoms and also the high calibration effort in determining manually the threshold value for each metric. In this article, we propose treating the generation of code-smell detection rules as a bilevel optimization problem. Bilevel optimization problems represent a class of challenging optimization problems, which contain two levels of optimization tasks. In these problems, only the optimal solutions to the lower-level problem become possible feasible candidates to the upper-level problem. In this sense, the code-smell detection problem can be treated as a bilevel optimization problem, but due to lack of suitable solution techniques, it has been attempted to be solved as a single-level optimization problem in the past. In our adaptation here, the upper-level problem generates a set of detection rules, a combination of quality metrics, which maximizes the coverage of the base of code-smell examples and artificial code smells generated by the lower level. The lower level maximizes the number of generated artificial code smells that cannot be detected by the rules produced by the upper level. The main advantage of our bilevel formulation is that the generation of detection rules is not limited to some code-smell examples identified manually by developers that are difficult to collect, but it allows the prediction of new code-smell behavior that is different from those of the base of examples. The statistical analysis of our experiments over 31 runs on nine open-source systems and one industrial project shows that seven types of code smells were detected with an average of more than 86% in terms of precision and recall. The results confirm the outperformance of our bilevel proposal compared to state-of-art code-smell detection techniques. The evaluation performed by software engineers also confirms the relevance of detected code smells to improve the quality of software systems.},

	Abstract = {To create a truly immersive virtual experience, perceiving information through multiple human senses is important. Therefore, new forms of media are required that deeply involve various human senses -not only sight, sound, and touch, but also nontraditional senses like taste and smell- to create a perception of presence in a non-physical environment. However, at present, the sensation of taste is considered as one of the final frontiers of immersive media to be achieved. This paper discusses key aspects and opportunities of including the sensation of taste in the future of immersive media technologies. As a solution, we then present 'Taste+' utensils that digitally enhance the taste sensations of food and beverages without additional flavoring ingredients. Finally, we envision several future usage scenarios and challenges of the indicated technology to facilitate future immersive digital experiences.},

When source code becomes very complex, it is difficult for developers to share and modify it. We can improve internal software qualities such as reusability, maintainability and readability through refactoring. Refactoring can be applied to remove possible problems in the code, as code smells. Identifying code smells and removing them through refactoring results in better code maintainability, but it can be an overwhelming task. In this paper, we describe our experimentation on using four refactoring tools to remove code smells in four systems, with the aim to outline advantages and disadvantages of the tools with respect to the accomplishment of this task, and to identify the smells easier to be removed among the ones we considered in this paper.},

	Abstract = {When using object-oriented frameworks it is easy to overlook certain important method calls that are required at particular places in code. In this article, we provide a comprehensive set of empirical facts on this problem, starting from traces of missing method calls in a bug repository. We propose a new system that searches for missing method calls in software based on the other method calls that are observable. Our key insight is that the voting theory concept of majority rule holds for method calls: a call is likely to be missing if there is a majority of similar pieces of code where this call is present. The evaluation shows that the system predictions go further missing method calls and often reveal different kinds of code smells (e.g., violations of API best practices).},

For this, the clusters are first identified and then these characteristics are observed. The identification of code smell clusters is performed in three steps - detection of code smells (God Class, Long Method, Feature Envy, Type Checking) using smell detection tools, extraction of their relationships by analyzing the source code architecture, and generation of graphs from the identified smells and their relationships, that finally reveals the smelly clusters.

	Abstract = {Source code bad smells are usually resolved through the application of well-defined solutions, i.e., refactorings. In the literature, software metrics are used as indicators of the existence and prioritization of resolving bad smells. In this paper, we focus on the long method smell (i.e. one of the most frequent and persistent bad smells) that can be resolved by the extract method refactoring. Until now, the identification of long methods or extract method opportunities has been performed based on cohesion, size or complexity metrics. However, the empirical validation of these metrics has exhibited relatively low accuracy with regard to their capacity to indicate the existence of long methods or extract method opportunities. Thus, we empirically explore the ability of size and cohesion metrics to predict the existence and the refactoring urgency of long method occurrences, through a case study on java open-source methods. The results of the study suggest that one size and four cohesion metrics are capable of characterizing the need and urgency for resolving the long method bad smell, with a higher accuracy compared to the previous studies. The obtained results are discussed by providing possible interpretations and implications to practitioners and researchers.},

This study aims to explore SCs occurring without taste changes during chemotherapy, to better understand the characteristics of such changes, and how these experiences affect patients in their daily lives. Data derives from a qualitative interview study and a cross-sectional survey of 518 patients, with all patients receiving out-patient cancer chemotherapy in Sweden. Case studies of three patients with SCs and the 8% of survey participants with SCs only are in focus. All 43 participants with exclusively SCs reported increased sensitivity to one or several odors, with no participants reporting decreased sensitivity. Those reporting SCs significantly more often reported weight gain than those reporting TSCs, with oral problems and appetite loss significantly less common in the SC group. There were no differences in reported nausea between SC and TSC groups, but nausea was more common in the SC group than in those without TSCs. The case study reports were linked to and discussed in relation to possible explanatory models for increased olfactory sensitivity. SCs increase during chemotherapy, were often unpredictable and led to emotional consequences. The participants all reported heightened sensitivity to one or several odors which could not fully be explained by the potential explanatory models of anticipatory nausea and vomiting, pseudohallucinations, or increased chemical sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {Objective
Olfactory dysfunction is known to have significant social, psychological, and safety implications. Despite increasingly recognized prevalence, potential risk factors for olfactory loss have been arbitrarily documented and knowledge is limited in scale. The aim of this study is to identify potential demographic and exposure variables correlating with olfactory dysfunction.
Methods
Cross-sectional analysis of the 2011--2012 and 2013--2014 editions of the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey was performed. The utilized survey reports from a nationally representative sample of about 5000 persons each year located in counties across the United States. There is an interview and physical examination component which includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions as well as medical, dental, physiologic measurements, and laboratory tests. 3594 adult respondents from 2011 to 2012 and 3708 respondents from 2013 to 2014 were identified from the above population-based database. The frequency of self-reported disorders as well as performance on odor identification testing was determined in relation to demographic factors, occupational or environmental exposures, and urinary levels of environmental and industrial compounds.
Results
In both subjective and objective analysis, smell disorders were significantly more common with increasing age. While the non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic Asian populations were less likely to report subjective olfactory loss, they, along with Hispanics, performed more poorly on odor identification than Caucasians. Those with limited education had a decreased prevalence of hyposmia. Women outperformed men on smell testing. Those reporting exposure to vapors were more likely to experience olfactory dysfunction, and urinary levels of manganese, 2-Thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-Aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid were lower among respondents with subjective smell disturbance. In odor detection, elevated serum levels of lead and urinary levels of 2,4 dichlorophenol were associated with anosmia and hyposmia, respectively.
Conclusions
This study provides current, population-based data identifying demographic and exposure elements related to smell disturbances in U.S. adults. Age, race, gender, education, exposure to vapors, urinary levels of manganese, 2-Thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, 2-Aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid, 2,4 dichlorophenol, and serum lead levels were all implicated in smell disturbance. Care should be taken in interpretation due to lack of consistency between subjective and objective measures of olfaction as well as limitations related to population-based data. Prospective trials are indicated to further elucidate these relationships.},

While the concept of quality is multidimensional, most of the effort in testing context has been channelled towards measuring test effectiveness. Objective: While effectiveness of tests is certainly important, we aim to identify a core list of testing principles that also address other quality facets of testing, and to discuss how they can be quantified as indicators of test quality. Method: We have conducted a two-day workshop with our industry partners to come up with a list of relevant principles and best practices expected to result in high quality tests. We then utilised our academic and industrial training materials together with recommendations in practitioner oriented testing books to refine the list. We surveyed existing literature for potential metrics to quantify identified principles. Results: We have identified a list of 15 testing principles to capture the essence of testing goals and best practices from quality perspective. Eight principles do not map to existing test smells and we propose metrics for six of those. Further, we have identified additional potential metrics for the seven principles that partially map to test smells. Conclusion: We provide a core list of testing principles along with a discussion of possible ways to quantify them for assessing goodness of tests. We believe that our work would be useful for practitioners in assessing the quality of their tests from multiple perspectives including but not limited to maintainability, comprehension and simplicity.},

	Abstract = {Background
Most existing olfactory identification (ID) tests have the primary aim of diagnosing clinical olfactory dysfunction, thereby rendering them sub-optimal for experimental settings where the aim is to detect differences in healthy subjects' odor ID abilities.
Materials and methods
We have developed an extended version of the olfactory ID subtest of the Sniffin' Sticks test battery to better assess the variability in ID scores and thereby olfactory abilities of healthy, adult individuals. Twenty-four odorants, corresponding cue labels, and distractor labels were added to the existing 16-item Sniffin' Sticks ID test to create the 40-item Monell Extended Sniffin' Sticks Identification Test (MONEX-40). The MONEX-40 was administered to 259 healthy young subjects, of which 72 were retested on an average of 212 days (SD 112 days) later.
Results
The added odor items demonstrated good validity, as shown by a significant correlation of the results with the original 16-item ID test. In addition, the MONEX-40 achieved a significant test--retest and split-half reliability.
Conclusions
Taken together, these results suggest that the MONEX-40 is a reliable method for experimental assessment of odor ID ability in healthy, young individuals. Moreover, its use of a wider range of odors allows the experimenter to present subsets of the MONEX-40 within the same experiment while maintaining statistical power.},

	Abstract = {One of the most important decisions researchers face when analyzing the evolution of software systems is the choice of a proper data analysis/exchange format. Most ex- isting formats have to be processed with special programs written specifically for that purpose and are not easily ex- tendible. Most scientists, therefore, use their own data- base(s) requiring each of them to repeat the work of writing the import/export programs to their format.
We present EvoOnt, a software repository data exchange format based on the Web Ontology Language (OWL). EvoOnt includes software, release, and bug-related infor- mation. Since OWL describes the semantics of the data, EvoOnt is (1) easily extendible, (2) comes with many ex- isting tools, and (3) allows to derive assertions through its inherent Description Logic reasoning capabilities.
The paper also shows iSPARQL -- our SPARQL-based Semantic Web query engine containing similarity joins. Together with EvoOnt, iSPARQL can accomplish a siz- able number of tasks sought in software repository mining projects, such as an assessment of the amount of change between versions or the detection of bad code smells. To illustrate the usefulness of EvoOnt (and iSPARQL), we per- form a series of experiments with a real-world Java project. These show that a number of software analyses can be re- duced to simple iSPARQL queries on an EvoOnt dataset.},

	Abstract = {Bad requirements quality can have expensive consequences during the software development lifecycle. Especially, if iterations are long and feedback comes late - the faster a problem is found, the cheaper it is to fix.
We propose to detect issues in requirements based on requirements (bad) smells by applying a light-weight static requirements analysis. This light-weight technique allows for instant checks as soon as a requirement is written down. In this paper, we derive a set of smells, including automatic smell detection, from the natural language criteria of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 standard.
We evaluated the approach with 336 requirements and 53 use cases from 9 specifications that were written by the car manufacturer Daimler AG and the chemical business company Wacker Chemie AG, and discussed the results with their requirements and domain experts.
While not all problems can be detected, the case study shows that lightweight smell analysis can uncover many practically relevant requirements defects. Based on these results and the discussion with our industry partners, we conclude that requirements smells can serve as an efficient supplement to traditional reviews or team discussions, in order to create fast feedback on requirements quality.},

	Abstract = {Rain changes its complexion based on the time and the place. Each aspect of rain provides a unique impression, so experiencing it in distant places and different times would be a new way of sharing information. To represent rain, we focused on an umbrella as a user interface to connect humans and rain. Generally, people experience rain with sounds, sights, or sometimes smells; however, in our proposed system, we exploit the vibration perceived through an umbrella's handle to let people feel the rain. We implemented a vibration-giving mechanism based on a speaker and microphone not only to give vibrations but also to record them so that they reconstruct rain. Using this mechanism, we propose a novel umbrella-like user interface named "Funbrella" that can record and replay the rain with FUN (Figure 1). We developed two interesting applications. One is to feel various kinds of rain, and the other transmits rain to different places in real time. With such applications, people can enjoy rain that is usually annoying.},

	Abstract = {We conducted two experiments based on the hypothesis that the taste, smell, and sight of (decaffeinated) coffee and internal senses of ingestion (caffeine-associated stimuli) would induce a conditioned response even when participants were informed that the drink was decaffeinated coffee. The caffeine-associated stimuli were supposed to be associated with caffeine because the participants drank coffee regularly. In experiment 1, forty-four coffee drinkers received decaffeinated coffee or water and completed a simple reaction time task. Reaction time was faster in the decaffeinated group than in the water group. In experiment 2, we examined whether the effect of decaffeinated coffee was extinguished by the repeated intake of decaffeinated coffee (conditioned stimulus). Forty-four coffee drinkers received decaffeinated coffee or water five times. Then, the participants drank decaffeinated coffee and completed a reaction time task. The effect of decaffeinated coffee was weakened in the test session by the extinction procedure: the repeated intake of decaffeinated coffee. In conclusion, both experiments supported the hypothesis that caffeine-associated stimuli induced a conditioned response in people who drank coffee regularly. Therefore, in everyday life, decaffeinated coffee may improve performance in coffee drinkers.},

@article{KRAUS201611,
	Abstract = {Desire, purchase, and consumption of fast-moving consumer goods often follow actual motivational states instead of habitual preferences. This has led to an increasing interest within health sciences to investigate the causes for irrational eating behaviours among consumers, particularly with the use of indirect measurements. However, literature results on the relationship between dynamic, motivational concepts (e.g., approach or avoidance tendencies) and evaluative concepts (e.g., positive or negative associations) remain inconclusive, possibly due to the use of different experimental manipulations and methodologies to operationalize these. Our aim with this study is to contribute to this line of research by developing a novel methodology that is based on structurally identical indirect measurement procedures. We measured explicit desire (motivation) and liking (evaluation) of two different foods (sandwich and sweets) on visual analogue scales, as well as implicit approach--avoidance tendencies and implicit positive--negative associations with two variants of the recoding-free Implicit Association Tests (IAT-RFs). At first, all participants (N=108) unwrapped, smelled, and explicitly judged the two foods, then all watched a video clip (during which half of the participants were allowed to eat the sandwich but not the sweets), and finally they all performed the two indirect measurements. Thus, desire for the foods was experimentally manipulated between participants. We hypothesized that a valid measure should show an interaction of food category (manipulated within participants) and desire fulfilment. Hence, explicit desire and implicit approach motivation should be higher for participants that were not allowed to consume the sandwich and fulfil their desire, compared to the group that was able to eat the sandwich during the experiment. Results confirm our hypothesis. The motivational IAT-RF correctly assessed approach tendencies towards the sandwich in the group that did not eat, and approach tendencies towards the sweets in the group that just ate a sandwich. In contrast, the evaluative IAT-RF measure did not reflect a clear ``preference'' towards any of the two popular products in both groups. This research provides a potentially relevant methodology for consumer studies' by offering a chance to differentiate between implicit motivational and evaluative concepts within consumer behaviour.},

@inproceedings{Brusatin:2011:CW:2037296.2037301,
	Abstract = {We can't say what color is: but we know what happens if (after a shock to the nape) we cease to see the colors. Some neuro-scientists, like Oliver Sacks, have explained such matter, by observing a painter, suddenly turned blind to colors, who went on, living with the memory of colors that he was no longer able to see, and the people from a small atoll in Micronesia, decimated by a tsunami wave, who, after some time, had selected its population in one half capable of seeing colors and committed to agriculture and a half blind to colors, committed to (nightly) fishing.
To seek an answer, we can say that color is not a phenomenon of light, but rather a perception and elaboration of our brain. But let's consider the first case.
Following a car crash, an American painter bangs his head against the windscreen of his car. No visible damages, only a small disappointment, apologies from the driver of the other car. These things happen. Apparently.
But that very evening, and still more the morning after, that painter R. became aware that he was no longer seeing colors. The world around him was suddenly empty of any chromatic stimulus. A world suddenly and completely gray, this is the first word. A world awfully dirty, this is the second sensation for something almost inconceivable, for a painter, nearly deadly. Even gray is a color, but such sudden monochrome shutoff is a dead color, the image of a world that can't be lived in.
The painter R. is suddenly become blind to colors. He can't see other than the ghosts of a light, surrounded by blurred shadows, now nearer, now farther. Starting from a black, now present and a moment later absent, a going till a concentration of stunning light beams, almost glaring.
An experience such as this one can't be really shared or described. Besides the sensation of an absurd and unmotivated torture, almost an experience of death, with respect to a mystery that human beings have in common with butterflies, the ability to see colors.
We can only try to understand how it feels. The painter R. moves along a sort of fog, that comes and goes, independently from his movements in the space of a room, or outside, hesitating from time to time, for fear of stumbling or trampling on something rotten.
The outer aspect of things and people, even those who are more familiar, is completely changed, and became dumb and hostile. The outline of the things and of the faces was vague and indefinite, and this uncertainty turned any visual interest into something unpleasant, and disappointing. Anything, and any action, becomes wrong and artificial, but most of all it becomes sort of stained, impure. The painter, for example, couldn't stand the change in the features of other people, and even the aspect of his own face in the mirror, that appeared like an empty window, with a 'person of smoke' inside.
The complexion of the people around him, including his own and that of his wife, was horribly gray and unrecognizable. The color of the skin, in all its possible shades, appeared like dirty paper, worn-out linen lacerated by terrible dirt. The (color) TV set was an unbearable atrocity, not even comparable to the reassuring black and white of old movies.
Food was a horrible litter. After a long abstinence from food, that almost lead him to consumption, the painter R. surrendered to eat blindfolded, relying on the memory of smell and flavor, because the pleasure of seeing a tasty dish was lost forever. All this only because of the lack of the colors.
The painter, luckily, maintained a sort of memory of colors, that, despite a sense of absence and detachment from the world, allowed him to imagine, always blindfolded, a pleasant sensation of reunion to the colorful forms of his former chromatic life. Poor comfort, which however he didn't want, and couldn't, give up, and by contrast even conceiving to commit suicide, when facing the despair of continuing to live in such a condition.
In his brain (and not in his eyes) something very serious had happened. He, following an injury, had lost the knowledge and sensation of color, while retaining the awareness, almost obsessive, of the lost color, which, just like any loss, became more and more the absolute meaning of vision. Not only a quality, but the truth of vision itself.
The painter R. was victim of a rare, yet possible, event. Just like an invisible bullet had hit and damaged forever the internals of his 'two beans', causing a paralysis. The ability of seeing colors results indeed essential for human activities, much more than monochrome vision, that is typical of most of mammals.
The reason why human beings are capable of seeing color remains a mystery, and we can only imagine what would happen when such ability is lost: our painter was prey to despair. Birds and snakes are capable of a four-color sight. Human beings had once the same capability, until (in the struggle for survival) the vision of two of the colors was lost, and later on, a third one was regained. This is how, today, human beings are capable of a three-colors perception, just like the monitor of common computers: R (red) G (green) B (blue), that the most advanced technology completes with Y (yellow).
However, the attention and the disposition of humans for colors seems to be perfectly aligned with human evolution and intelligence. It may sound impossible, but 77.000 years ago, in Blombos Cave (South Africa) primitive people were able to manufacture and collect a huge amount of colored sticks, decorated with geometric motifs, presumably used for body painting. The aesthetic attitude towards the world becomes their ability to survive in the race to evolution. Letting at the same time their brain cortex grow. Through colors.},

	Abstract = {Most consumers have positive attitudes toward seafood and consider it to be an important part of a healthy and balanced diet. However when purchasing seafood, consumers also weigh up various risks which may act as barriers to consumption. In this paper, the findings of an online survey of Australian consumers (n=899) which explored both drivers and barriers to seafood consumption are discussed. The primary focus of this paper is to explore the perceived risks of seafood consumption and how these vary across consumption levels. Perceived risks associated with seafood consumption include functional, social, physical, psychological, and financial risk. With the exceptions of physical and financial risk, perceptions of risk varied across regular, light and very light seafood consumption segments. Lighter fish consumers were more likely to perceive functional risk associated with being less informed and less familiar with fish, experience more difficulties with selecting fish, recognising if fish is fresh, and preparing and serving fish than more regular fish consumers. Regular seafood consumers were less likely than lighter seafood consumers to perceive social risk arising from other members of their household not liking fish. Moreover, regular seafood consumers were less likely to perceive psychological risks associated with unpleasant past experiences or unpleasant sensory qualities, such as not liking the smell of fish and not liking to touch fish. Based on these results strategies for reducing perceived risks as a means of stimulating fish consumption are proposed for further investigation.},

The architecture of a SPL comprises a model that will result in product architectures, and may include solutions leading to bad (architectural) design. One way to assess such design decisions is through the identification of architectural bad smells, which are properties that prejudice the overall software quality, but are not necessarily faulty or errant. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study that aims at characterizing bad smells in the context of product line architectures. We analyzed an open source SPL project and extracted its architecture to investigate the occurrence or absence of four smells initially studied in single systems. In addition, we propose a smell specific to the SPL context and discuss possible causes and implications of having those smells in the architecture of a product line. The results indicate that the granularity of the SPL features may influence on the occurrence of smells.},

	Abstract = {The focus of this study is to find the appropriateness of the Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) neural network (NN) training algorithm for recognition of odor patterns associated with an electronic nose (e-nose). Multiple time-patterns represent step response of the array of sensors to the odorants. The experiments are performed on four representative classes of odorants: coffees, fragrances, hog farm air, and cola beverages. The odor recognition system is composed of a Karhunen--Lo{\'e}ve (KL) based pre-processing unit, and a feedforward neural network with the LM training algorithm. The parameters of the pre-processing unit and the neural network are fine-tuned using a genetic algorithm. Back-propagation algorithm with adaptive learning rate is selected as a standard neural network training method, for the purpose of comparison. The results of the experiments indicate that the LM algorithm provides high correct recognition ratios. In addition, the results confirm that the LM method outperforms the back-propagation (BP) method with adaptive learning rate, for the classes of the odorants provided in this study.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
A 2D-DIGE proteomics experiment was performed to describe the mechanism underlying the production of geosmin, an earthy-smelling sesquiterpene which spoils wine, produced by Penicillium expansum. The strains were identified by sequencing of the ITS and beta-tubulin regions. This study was based on a selection of four strains showing different levels of geosmin production, assessed by GC--MS/MS. The proteomics study revealed the differential abundance of 107 spots between the different strains; these were picked and submitted to MALDI-TOF--TOF MS analysis for identification. They belonged to the functional categories of protein metabolism, redox homeostasis, metabolic processes (glycolysis, ATP production), cell cycle and cell signalling pathways. From these data, an implication of oxidative stress in geosmin production may be hypothesized. Moreover, the differential abundance of some glycolytic enzymes may explain the different patterns of geosmin biosynthesis. This study provides data for the characterisation of the mechanism and the regulation of the production of this off-flavour, which are so far not described in filamentous fungi.
Biological significance
Green mould on grapes, caused by P. expansum may be at the origin of off-flavours in wine. These are characterized by earthy--mouldy smells and are due to the presence of the compound geosmin. This work aims at describing how geosmin is produced by P. expansum. This knowledge is of use for the research community on grapes for understanding why these off-flavours occasionally occur in vintages.},

E-government, however, is considered complex and e-government failures are well known from media. Research of how e-government is enacted inside government is sparse. Technology mediated public services in real world entail ethical dilemmas. By extracting ethical dilemmas from a qualitative e-government participatory design study, this paper shows how ethical dilemmas may inform future e-government design and design processes. The case, adoption of digital post in a local e-government setting, showed that design flaws, staff's concern for citizens and political fear of citizens' critique had an impact on e-government adoption.},

	Abstract = {The interfaces of software components are often paired with specifications or protocols that prescribe correct and safe usage. An important class of these specifications consists of temporal safety properties over function or method call sequences. Because violations of these properties can lead to program crashes or subtly inconsistent program state, these properties are frequently the target of runtime monitoring techniques. However, the properties must be specified in advance, a time-consuming process. Recognizing this problem, researchers have proposed various specification inference techniques, but they suffer from imprecision and require a significant investment in developer time.
This work presents the first fully automatic dynamic technique for simultaneously learning and enforcing general temporal properties over method call sequences. Our technique is an online algorithm that operates over a short, finite execution history. This limited view works well in practice due to the inherent temporal locality in sequential method calls on Java objects, a property we validate empirically. We have implemented our algorithm in a practical tool for Java, Ocd, that operates with a high degree of precision and finds new defects and code smells in well-tested applications.},

	Abstract = {Setting up a new product line generation in a mature domain, typically does not start from scratch but takes into consideration the architecture and assets of the former product line generation. Being able to accommodate legacy and 3rd party code is one of the major product line qualities to be met. On the other side, product line qualities like reusability, maintainability and alterability, i.e. being able to cope up with a large amount of variability, with configurability and fast integratability are major drivers.
While setting up a new product line generation and thus a new corresponding architecture, we this time focused on architectural software (SW) health and tracking of architectural metrics from the very beginning. Taking the definition of "architecture being a set of design decisions" [18] literally, we attempt to implement an architectural check for every design decision taken. Architectural design decisions in our understanding do not only - and even not mainly - deal with the definition of components and their interaction but with patterns and rules or anti-patterns. The rules and anti-patterns, "what not to do" or more often also "what not to do <u>any more</u>", is even more important in setting up a new product line generation because developers are not only used to the old style of developing and the old architecture, but also still have to develop assets for both generations.
In this article we describe selected architectural checks that we have implemented, the layered architecture check and the check for usage of obsolete services. Additionally we discuss selected architectural metrics: the coupling coefficient metrics and the instability metrics. In the summary and outlook we describe our experiences and still open topics in setting up architectural SW health checks for a large-scale product line.
The real-world examples are taken from the domain of Engine Control Unit development at Robert Bosch GmbH.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a novel binary fruit fly optimization algorithm (bFOA) is proposed to solve the multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP). In the bFOA, binary string is used to represent the solution of the MKP, and three main search processes are designed to perform evolutionary search, including smell-based search process, local vision-based search process and global vision-based search process. In particular, a group generating probability vector is designed for producing new solutions. To enhance the exploration ability, a global vision mechanism based on differential information among fruit flies is proposed to update the probability vector. Meanwhile, two repair operators are employed to guarantee the feasibility of solutions. The influence of the parameter setting is investigated based on the Taguchi method of design of experiment. Extensive numerical testing results based on benchmark instances are provided. And the comparisons to the existing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bFOA in solving the MKP, especially for the large-scale problems.},

	Abstract = {While domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, have been found to be skillful at social cognitive tasks and even some meta-cognitive tasks, they have not passed the test of mirror self-recognition (MSR). Acknowledging the motivational and sensory challenges that might hinder performance, even before the question of self-recognition is broached, this study creates and enacts a novel design extrapolated from the species' natural behaviour. Given dogs' use of olfactory signals in communication, this experiment presents dogs with various canisters for approach and investigation. Each holds an odorous stimulus: in the critical test, either an ``olfactory mirror'' of the subject − the dog's own urine − or one in which the odour stimulus is modified. By looking at subjects' investigation times of each canister, it is shown that dogs distinguish between the olfactory ``image'' of themselves when modified: investigating their own odour for longer when it had an additional odour accompanying it than when it did not. Such behaviour implies a recognition of the odour as being of or from ``themselves. The ecological validity of this odour presentation is examined by presenting to the subjects odours of other known or unknown dogs: dogs spend longer investigating the odour of other dogs than their own odour. Finally, in a second experiment, subjects spent longer with the modified stimulus than with the modified odour by itself, indicating that novelty alone does not explain the dogs' behavior. This study translates the MSR study for a species whose primary sensory modality is olfaction, and finds both that natural sniffing behaviour can be replicated in the lab and that dogs show more investigative interest in their own odours when modified.},

	Abstract = {To date very little research has been done on sensory interaction taking into account the temporal component. The objectives of this work were to better understand the influence of aroma perception on taste and texture perception in a real food matrix such as the apple, considering sensory perception both as a static and dynamic process. Another objective was to evaluate the suitability of Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) for studying sensory interaction. A set of 9 apple samples, made up of apple discs modified with two distinct aromas (3-methylbutyl acetate and (E)-3-hexen-1-ol) and/or two tastants (fructose and dl-malic acid), was used for the experiment. Samples were analysed by Descriptive Analysis (DA) and TDS performed by two different panels. Samples were also analysed using instrumental measurement of texture, sugar and volatile content. Aroma addition modified perception of the apple in both a static and dynamic way. Some texture-aroma and taste-aroma interaction were highlighted. TDS showed that both aromas made perception of hardness and juiciness less dominant. In some cases, banana aroma modified sweet taste perception and when used without tastants, it tended to anticipate sweetness perception in time. DA evidenced different results: both aromas decreased crunchiness or flouriness intensities when used alone or with fructose respectively. They increased juiciness intensity when combined with malic acid. TDS confirmed well-known relations between taste and smell and showed its appropriateness for studying sensory interaction. Its combination with DA gathered complementary points of view enriching the analysis and revealing unexpected or time-related interaction, a new perspective for understanding the phenomena linked to perception.},

@article{KEBIR201717,
	Abstract = {Context: During its lifecycle, a software system undergoes repeated modifications to quickly fulfill new requirements, but its underlying design is not properly adjusted after each update. This leads to the emergence of bad smells. Refactoring provides a de facto behavior-preserving approach to eliminate these anomalies. However, manually determining and performing useful refactorings is a formidable challenge, as stated in the literature. Therefore, framing object-oriented automated refactoring as a search-based technique has been proposed. However, the literature shows that search-based refactoring of component-based software has not yet received proper attention. Objective: This paper presents a genetic algorithm-based approach for the automated refactoring of component-based software. This approach consists of detecting component-relevant bad smells and eliminating these bad smells by searching for the best sequence of refactorings using a genetic algorithm. Method: Our approach consists of four steps. The first step includes studying the literature related to component-relevant bad smells and formulating bad smell detection rules. The second step involves proposing a catalog of component-relevant refactorings. The third step consists of constructing a source code model by extracting facts from the source code of a component-based software. The final step seeks to identify the best sequence of refactorings to apply to reduce the presence of bad smells in the source code model using a genetic algorithm. The latter uses bad smell detection rules as a fitness function and the catalog of refactorings as a means to explore the search space. Results: As a case study, we conducted experiments on an unbiased set of four real-world component-based applications. The results indicate that our approach is able to efficiently reduce the total number of bad smells by more than one half, which is an acceptable value compared to the recent literature. Moreover, we determined that our approach is also accurate in refactoring only components suffering from bad smells while leaving the remaining components untouched whenever possible. Furthermore, a statistical analysis shows that our genetic algorithm outperforms random search and local search in terms of efficiency and accuracy on almost all the systems investigated in this work. Conclusion: This paper presents a search-based approach for the automated refactoring of component-based software. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to focus on component-based refactoring, whereas the state-of-the-art approaches focus only on object-oriented refactoring.},

We investigated how a dehydrated food product was experienced at different stages of product usage: choosing a product on a supermarket shelf, opening a package, cooking and eating the food. At the buying stage, vision was the most important modality, followed by taste. Smell was dominant at the cooking stage, and taste was the most important sensation while eating the food. Analysis of the emotional dynamics showed that ratings for satisfaction and pleasant surprise tended to be lowest during the buying stages. Fascination and boredom ratings tended to decrease gradually over the course of the experiment. Comments mostly reflected responses to sensory qualities, usability aspects, and the nature of the product. At the purchase stage, pre-existing attitudes and stereotypes towards the product group seemed to play a major role in affective reactions, while in the other stages when other modalities were actively involved, participants' emotional judgements reflected mainly their direct sensory experience.},

However the factors determining stress in corals when exposed to short-term sedimentation, including the interactions between sediments and nutrients, are little understood. We exposed corals to ten different sediment types at environmentally relevant concentrations (33 to 160 mg DW cm−2) and exposure times (12 to 60 h) in laboratory and field experiments. The sediments originated from 2 estuaries, 2 nearshore and one offshore locations and also included ground-up aragonite. For two of these sediments, three grain size fractions were used (silt <63 μm, fine sand: 63--250 μm, medium sand: 250--500 μm). Sediments were characterised by 19 parameters grouped into ``physical'', ``organic and nutrient-related'' and ``geochemical'' parameters. Changes in the photosynthetic yield of the coral Montipora peltiformis was measured by pulse--amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorometry (PAM) as proxy for photophysiological stress from exposure, and to determine rates of recovery. Different sediments exerted greatly contrasting levels of stress in the corals. Our results show that grain size and organic and nutrient-related sediment properties are key factors determining sedimentation stress in corals after short-term exposure. Photophysiological stress was measurable after 36 h of exposure to most of the silt-sized sediments, and coral recovery was incomplete after 48 to 96 h recovery time. The four sandy sediment types caused no measurable stress at the same concentration for the same exposure time. Stress levels were strongly related to the values of organic and nutrient-related parameters in the sediment, weakly related to the physical parameters and unrelated to the geochemical parameters measured. M. peltiformis removed the sandy grain size classes more easily than the silt, and nutrient-poor sediments were removed more easily than nutrient-rich sediments. Anoxia developed on the sediment surfaces of the nutrient-rich silts, which had become slimy and smelled of hydrogen sulphide, suggesting increased bacterial activity. Our finding that silt-sized and nutrient-rich sediments can stress corals after short exposure, while sandy sediments or nutrient-poor silts affect corals to a lesser extent, will help refining predictions of sedimentation threats to coral reefs at given environmental conditions.},

	Abstract = {One of the widely used techniques to improve the quality of software systems is refactoring. Software refactoring improves the internal structure of the system while preserving its external behavior. These two concerns drive the existing approaches to refactoring automation. However, recent studies demonstrated that these concerns are not enough to produce correct and consistent refactoring solutions. In addition to quality improvement and behavior preservation, studies consider, among others, construct semantics preservation and minimization of changes. From another perspective, development history was proven as a powerful source of knowledge in many maintenance tasks. Still, development history is not widely explored in the context of automated software refactoring. In this paper, we use the development history collected from existing software projects to propose new refactoring solutions taking into account context similarity with situations seen in the past. We propose a multi-objective optimization-based approach to find good refactoring sequences that (1) minimize the number of code-smells, and (2) maximize the use of development history while (3) preserving the construct semantics. To this end, we use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to find the best trade-offs between these three objectives. We evaluate our approach using a benchmark composed of five medium and large-size open-source systems and four types of code-smells (Blob, spaghetti code, functional decomposition, and data class). Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach, compared to three different state-of-the-art approaches, with more than 85% of code-smells fixed and 86% of suggested refactorings semantically coherent when the change history is used.},

	Abstract = {Design degradation has long been assessed by means of structural analyses applied on successive versions of a software system. More recently, repository mining techniques have been developed in order to uncover rich historical information of software projects. In this paper, we leverage such information and propose an approach to assess design degradation that is programming language agnostic and relies almost exclusively on commit metadata. Our approach currently focuses on the assessment of two particular design smells: rigidity and fragility. Rigidity refer to designs that are difficult to change due to ripple effects and fragility refer to designs that tend to break in different areas every time a change is performed. We conducted an evaluation of our approach in the project Apache Maven 1 and the results indicated that our approach is feasible and that the project suffered from increasing fragility.},

	Abstract = {As a traditional dynamic language, Python is increasingly used in various software engineering tasks. However, due to its flexibility and dynamism, Python is a particularly challenging language to write code in and maintain. Consequently, Python programs contain code smells which indicate potential comprehension and maintenance problems. With the aim of supporting refactoring strategies to enhance maintainability, this paper describes how to detect code smells in Python programs. We introduce 11 Python smells and describe the detection strategy. We also implement a smell detection tool named Pysmell and use it to identify code smells in five real world Python systems. The results show that Pysmell can detect 285 code smell instances in total with the average precision of 97.7%. It reveals that Large Class and Large Method are most prevalent. Our experiment also implies Python programs may be suffering code smells further.},

This is the first survey on clone management, where we point to the achievements so far, and reveal avenues for further research necessary towards an integrated clone management system.

	Abstract = {In this research, we aim to realize a gustatory display that enhances our experience of enjoying food. However, generating a sense of taste is very difficult because the human gustatory system is quite complicated and is not yet fully understood. This is so because gustatory sensation is based on chemical signals whereas visual and auditory sensations are based on physical signals. In addition, the brain perceives flavor by combining the senses of gustation, smell, sight, warmth, memory, etc. The aim of our research is to apply the complexity of the gustatory system in order to realize a pseudo-gustatory display that presents flavors by means of visual feedback. This paper reports on the prototype system of such a display that enables us to experience various tastes without changing their chemical composition through the superimposition of virtual color. The fundamental thrust of our experiment is to evaluate the influence of cross-sensory effects by superimposing virtual color onto actual drinks and recording the responses of subjects who drink them. On the basis of experimental results, we concluded that visual feedback sufficiently affects our perception of flavor to justify the construction of pseudo-gustatory displays.},

Therefore, several tools have been proposed to automate bad smell detection aiming to improve software maintainability. However, we lack a detailed study for summarizing and comparing the wide range of available tools. In this paper, we first present the findings of a systematic literature review of bad smell detection tools. As results of this review, we found 84 tools; 29 of them available online for download. Altogether, these tools aim to detect 61 bad smells by relying on at least six different detection techniques. They also target different programming languages, such as Java, C, C++, and C#. Following up the systematic review, we present a comparative study of four detection tools with respect to two bad smells: Large Class and Long Method. This study relies on two software systems and three metrics for comparison: agreement, recall, and precision. Our findings support that tools provide redundant detection results for the same bad smell. Based on quantitative and qualitative data, we also discuss relevant usability issues and propose guidelines for developers of detection tools.},

@article{ZAFEIRIS201719,
	Abstract = {Context: Implementation inheritance, i.e., overriding of concrete method implementations through subtyping, is prone to potential class contract violations. Call Super is a code pattern that employs implementation inheritance for extending a method's behaviour. In Call Super the overriding method includes in its body an invocation to the overridden method. Template Method is a design pattern that enables extensions to a multi-step procedure without overriding its concrete implementation. Instead, subclasses provide different variants of the template method's behaviour through implementation of abstract method definitions (interface inheritance). Objective: This work studies the automated refactoring of Call Super to Template Method, contributing, thus, to replacement of implementation inheritance with interface inheritance. Method: We introduce an algorithm for the discovery of refactoring candidates that is based on an extensive set of refactoring preconditions. Moreover, we specify the source code transformation for refactoring a Call Super instance to Template Method. An implementation of the proposed approach is evaluated on a set of open source Java projects. Results: The evaluation results highlight (a) the frequent occurrence of the Call Super pattern among method overridings, (b) the potential provided by our method for discovery and elimination of several non-trivial Call Super instances and (c) the resulting code improvement, as reflected by the Specialization Index metric and the alignment of refactored code with the programmer's intent. The application of all refactorings identified on a set of benchmark projects and the successful execution of their test suites provide empirical evidence on the soundness of the refactoring procedure. Runtime performance results support the scalability of the proposed method. Conclusion: The proposed method automates the replacement of implementation inheritance with interface inheritance through refactoring Call Super instances to Template Method. The empirical evaluation of the method supports its applicability, soundness and runtime efficiency.},

Beyond social factors, we believe that there are at least two main elements that contribute to this lack of adoption: (i) the insufficient integration of existing techniques in mainstream IDEs and (ii) the lack of support for a continuous (daily) usage of QA tools. In this context this paper introduces inCode, an Eclipse plugin aimed at transforming quality assessment and code inspections from a standalone activity, into a continuous process, fully integrated in the development life-cycle. But inCode not only assesses continuously the quality of Java systems; it also assists developers in taking restructuring decisions, and even supports them in triggering non-standard, complex refactorings. This paper introduces inCode's differentiating features, it presents the design goals that shaped our construction decisions, and describes a controlled experiment designed to validate the usability of the tool. The experiment has indicated that developers using inCode are more efficient in refactoring design fragments affected by design flaws.},

	Abstract = {Realism in real-time has long been a "holy grail" of the computer graphics community. While real-time performance is typically accepted as 25fps and above, the definition of realism remains less clear. If we were able to simulate the physics of the real world to minute detail then it would be possible for us to achieve images which were physically correct. However, the amount of computation required for such physical accuracy of complex scenes precludes any possibility of achieving such images in reasonable, let alone real-time, on a desktop computer for many years to come. Furthermore, there is no guarantee of realism as these images do not take into account how the human may perceive this information. Our perception of an environment is not only what we see, but may be significantly influenced by other sensory input, including sound, smell, touch, and even taste. If virtual environments are ever to be regularly used as a valuable tool to experiment in the virtual world with confidence that the results are the same as would be experienced in the real world, then we need to be able to compute these environments to be perceptually equivalent as if we were "there" in the real world; so called "there-reality" or real virtuality. This paper surveys promising efforts to date and identifies and discusses future research directions.},

In current system development practice, it often inevitably exists some "anti-patterns", which usually impede the performance or maintainability of software systems. Manually investigating anti-patterns in systems is a time-consuming and labor intensive task. To deal with this problem, we propose a general anti-pattern detection approach for Java EE application. Firstly, we propose a Java EE meta-model, based on which, we use QVT language to specify the detection process of anti-patterns. Secondly, we implement our approach on a runtime architecture-based reflective framework. When a Java EE application runs on one of the supported application servers, we can execute QVT script to detect whether or not there exists a specific anti-pattern in current system and get the report of potential problem components. At last, we perform a case study based on 35 well-known anti-patterns to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach.},

Building on a growing attention to the sensory elements of spaces of health and wellbeing, this article mobilises empirical research on `care farming' practices to discuss how smellscapes come to be crucial in fulfilling anticipations, imaginations, and expectations of a `therapeutic space'. This article highlights how embodied relationships with specific scents can constitute a therapeutic encounter with place, actively influencing practices and engagement with(in) place, and the ways by which place can have a meaningful affect on health.},

	Abstract = {A previous study by Bieman et al., investigated whether large, object-oriented classes were more susceptible to change than smaller classes. The measure of change used in the study was the frequency with which the features of a class had been changed over a specific period of time. From a refactoring perspective, the frequency of class change is of value But even for a relatively simple refactoring such as 'rename method', multiple classes may undergo minor modification without any net increase in class (and system) size. In this paper, we suggest that the combination of 'versions of a class and number of added lines of code ' in the bad code 'smell' detection process may give a better impression of which classes are most suitable candidates for refactoring; as such, effort in detecting bad code smells should apply to classes with a high growth rate as well as a high change frequency. To support our investigation, data relating to changes from 161 Java classes was collected. Results concluded that it is not necessarily the case that large classes are more change-prone than relatively smaller classes. Moreover, the bad code smell detection process is informed by using the combination of change frequency and class size as a heuristic.},

The treatments were: Brachiaria brizantha hay ad libitum, either unsupplemented or supplemented with 2 kg or 3 kg of Moringa on a dry matter (DM) basis. Six Bos indicus cows of the Creole Reyna breed, with a mean body weight of 394$\pm$24 kg were used in a replicated 3×3 Latin square design. Supplementation with Moringa increased (P<0.05) DM intake from 8.5 to 10.2 and 11.0 kg DM day−1 and milk production from 3.1 to 4.9 and 5.1 kg day−1 for B. brizantha hay only and supplementation with 2 kg and 3 kg DM of Moringa, respectively. Milk fat, total solids and crude protein and organoleptic characteristics, smell, taste and colour, were not significantly different between the diets. Apparent digestibility coefficients of DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF increased (P<0.05) in the diets supplemented with Moringa compared with B. brizantha hay alone. The results showed that the inclusion of Moringa as a protein supplement to low quality diets improved DM intake and digestibility of the diet and increased milk production but did not affect milk composition.},

	Abstract = {Complex refactoring processes, such as applying big refactorings or removing design smells are difficult to perform in practice. The complexity of these processes is partly due to their heuristic nature and to the constraints imposed by preconditions on the applicability of the individual refactorings. We introduce refactoring strategies as heuristic-based, automation-suitable specifications of a complex refactoring process. They allow us to specify correction strategies and big refactorings more formally than it is done in current catalogues. Refactoring strategies can be instantiated, for each particular case, into refactoring plans. We define refactoring plans as sequences of refactorings that are immediately applicable over the current system source code. We have developed an approach for instantiating refactoring strategies into refactoring plans that uses Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning. This paper describes this approach and presents a case study, in order to evaluate and characterise it.},

	Abstract = {Location-based social network systems (LBSNSs) are becoming increasingly popular. At the same time, privacy of users' information in these systems is becoming a huge concern. In LBSNSs, such as Foursquare, users' residential addresses and their check-ins at the residential venues are regarded as sensitive and private information as the exposure of such information can reveal users' home addresses and their absence from their homes. Analysis of users' activities involving residential venues in LBSNSs, therefore, provides useful insights into users' residential privacy concerns. In addition, such analysis can help researchers to better understand users' activities related to their residential privacy so as to develop better privacy protection mechanisms. In this paper, we first analyze Foursquare data to explore the following questions related to users' residential privacy: 1) how users share the addresses of the residential venues; 2) how users share their check-ins at the residential venues. Our analysis shows that users tend to be aware of their residential privacy and try to protect their personal information in Foursquare. During the data analysis, we also identify several system vulnerabilities and privacy risks that can be exploited to violate users' residential privacy in Foursquare. Such vulnerabilities and privacy risks are actually caused by the system's design flaws and users' incautious activities. Based on the results of the data analysis, we then propose a framework that includes access control and alert mechanisms to address these privacy issues.},

	Abstract = {An operating system forms the foundation for all of the user's computer activities. Therefore, it should be trustworthy and function flawlessly. Unfortunately, today's operating systems, such as Windows and Linux, fail to deliver to this ideal, because they suffer from fundamental design flaws and bugs. Their monolithic kernel tend be overloaded with functionality that runs at the highest privilege level. This easily introduces bugs and breaches the Principle of Least Authorization (POLA) with all the related risks. Microkernel operating systems have a different design that makes them less vulnerable to these problems. A microkernel provides only a minimal set of abstractions that runs at the highest privilege level. Extended operating system functionality is typically available by means of user-space servers. By splitting an operating system into small, independent parts, the system becomes less complex and more robust, because the smaller parts are more manageable and help to isolate faults, respectively. This paper reviews the concepts and mechanisms used to improve security in Microkernel Operating system and described in brief about two real-world microkernel operating system, trying to achieve security as its goal.},

	Abstract = {Farrowing crates prevent sows during lactation from moving freely and interacting unrestrictedly with their piglets. The aim of this study was to compare sows during lactation in a group-housing system (GH; n=23) and sows in a conventional single-housing system (SH; n=24) with regard to their maternal behaviour. GH sows were only fixed in their pens three days ante partum until one day post partum. For the remaining amount of time they were able to choose between their home pen and a shared running area. Piglets were able to leave their pens on day five post partum. Data were collected in four batches with six sows in each housing system. All sows were observed in week 2 and week 4 of lactation in six successive tests concerning their maternal behaviour. The sows' reaction to piglet distress calls, separation from and reunion with their piglets was tested both in their home pens and in a test arena for a maximum of five minutes. The test arena (3.9m×3.7m) provided a piglet nest in a corner. The sows were only able to hear and smell their piglets. In the piglet scream test in the home pen, GH sows were more responsive to piglet screaming than SH sows. GH sows showed more body movements towards their screaming piglets and aggressiveness towards the experimenter (p<0.05) as well as stronger postural reactions at the end of the test; i.e. standing (p<0.05). However, in the piglet scream test in the test arena, SH sows remained near their handled piglet more frequently (p<0.05) and vocalised more frequently (p<0.05). Whereas, GH sows tended to explore the test arena more (p<0.10). During the separation test in the home pen, no behavioural differences between GH and SH sows could be obtained. During the separation test in the test arena, all sows remained near the piglet nest with their piglets. Furthermore, SH sows walked more (p<0.05), while GH sows explored the test arena more frequently (p<0.05). In the reunion test in the home pen, GH sows tended to vocalise more frequently (p<0.10). No behavioural differences could be found between GH and SH sows in the reunion test in the test arena. Regarding total piglet losses (e.g. crushing, underweight, runting, spay legs), GH sows had lower total losses compared to SH sows (p<0.05). Furthermore, GH sows crushed fewer piglets than SH sows (p<0.05). To conclude, GH sows showed stronger behavioural reactions in the home pen and SH sows in the test arena. Thus, the housing system has an effect on maternal behaviour. Further research is needed to obtain more information, if the significantly lower piglet losses of GH sows are related to the stronger maternal reactions in the home pens of these sows and to the housing conditions ante partum.},

As the chances for remote families to enjoy shared entertainment are decreasing greatly nowadays, we propose "Food Media" as an intuitive multimodal interaction platform to engage remote people into social communication and entertainment within the telepresent family dinner context. Rather than fancy multimedia or computerized social games, this system breathes interactive entertainment into domestic routine activities of family dining, introduces multi-sensory interactions like touch, smell and taste to support enriched experience of interaction, connects and entertains people over a natural and playful eating experience.},

Smell is used as the evocative interface between the artwork and the visitors. When a visitor passed by a certain area, it would trigger the odor emission in another area for the other visitors. The visitors on another side could trigger the odor emission back as well. Throughout the experience, visitors can freely explore the scents around the area of the artwork. In addition, the visitors can express their memories of smell through writing onto origami boxes which contribute as a part of the city model of the artwork. The artwork consisted of all the visitors' memories expression and communication at the end of exhibition. The aim of this paper is neither technology investigation nor user experience evaluation. Instead it is an open-end exploration which questions the role of olfactory interface in art museum context and provokes the insights about olfactory interaction design in Human-Computer Interaction. The artwork becomes the inspirational probe to explore the possibilities of olfactory interface with the users when designing for communication. The benefits and drawbacks of the chosen approach towards olfactory interaction design would be discussed. I would also address the lessons learned behind throughout the process.},

They are particularly useful for rescuing projects from high bug counts, delayed releases, and dissatisfied customers. Functional tests help projects by elucidating requirements, making project progress visible, and preventing bugs. We present functional testing in pattern format because it is especially expressive in conveying expert advice and enables the reader to make an informed decision regarding the applicability of the solution. The pattern presented aggregates multiple experiences with functional testing over several agile development projects. However, we have seen functional testing become more costly than its benefits, so we describe the symptoms--"smells"--of potentially costly problems. These are not problems with functional testing per se, but with the misinterpretation and mis-implementation of this practice. We draw on our experience to suggest ways of addressing these smells. Done right, functional testing successfully increases software's quality and business value.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an effective fruit fly optimisation algorithm (FOA) to solve the steelmaking casting problem. First, we model the realistic problem as a hybrid flow shop (HFS) scheduling problem with batching in the last stage. Next, the proposed FOA algorithm is applied to solve the realistic HFS problems. In the proposed algorithm, each solution is represented by a fruit fly. Each fruit fly first improves its status through a well-designed smell search procedure. During the vision-based search procedure, the worst fruit fly in the population will be induced by the best fruit fly found thus far to improve the exploitation ability of the entire fruit fly population further. To enhance the exploration ability of the proposed algorithm, in each generation, each fruit fly that has not updated its status during the last several iterations will be replaced by a newly-generated fruit fly. The proposed algorithm is tested on sets of the instances that are generated based on the realistic production. Moreover, the influence of the parameter setting is also investigated using the Taguchi method of the design-of-experiment (DOE) to determine the suitable values for the key parameters. The results indicate that the proposed FOA is more effective than the four presented algorithms.},

	Abstract = {This work discusses basic human senses: sight; sound; touch; taste; and smell; and the way in which it may be possible to compensate for lack of one, or more, of these by explicitly representing stimuli using the remaining senses. There may be many situations or scenarios where not all five of these base senses are being stimulated, either because of an optional restriction or deficit or because of a physical or sensory impairment such as loss of sight or touch sensation. Related to this there are other scenarios where sensory matching problems may occur. For example: a user immersed in a virtual environment may have a sense of smell from the real world that is unconnected to the virtual world. In particular, this paper is concerned with how sound can be used to compensate for the lack of other sensory stimulation and vice-versa. As a link is well established already between the visual, touch, and auditory systems, more attention is given to taste and smell, and their relationship with sound. This work presents theoretical concepts, largely oriented around mapping other sensory qualities to sound, based upon existing work in the literature and emerging technologies, to discuss where particular gaps currently exist, how emotion could be a medium to cross-modal representations, and how these might be addressed in future research. It is postulated that descriptive qualities, such as timbre or emotion, are currently the most viable routes for further study and that this may be later integrated with the wider body of research into sensory augmentation.},

	Abstract = {A large amount of data repositories became available due to the advances in information and communication technology. Those repositories, however, are highly semantically heterogeneous, which hinders their integration. Ontology alignment has been successfully applied to solve this problem, by discovering correspondences between two distinct ontologies which, in turn, conceptually define the data stored in each repository. Among the various ontology alignment approaches that exist in the literature, interactive ontology alignment includes the participation of experts to improve the quality of the final alignment. An important issue for interactive ontology alignment proposals is to maximize the efficiency of the expert participation. According to OAEI (an evaluation initiative conducted annually), despite the advances in this field there are still recurrent errors in the final alignments obtained by the interactive ontology alignment proposals. In this paper we propose ALIN, an interactive ontology alignment approach that increases the efficiency of the expert participation through the use of alignment anti-patterns. ALIN was evaluated considering three anti-patterns available in the literature, and the results proved the potential of the approach.},

Short-term adoption tests were carried out 7--10 days after the training. The extent of short-term adoption of the technique varied by the training topic. For egg-coated nsima, the overall short-term adoption rate was a little over 60% across the groups, while the rate for egg-coated pumpkin flower was around 32%. This rate for the former practice was significantly lower in the video group (50.9%) than in the traditional demonstration group (75.6%) mainly because the participants were unable to taste and smell the food during the video training. The adoption rate for the latter practice was similar between the two groups.},

These primes are then evaluated in a controlled experiment. From these studies implications for both researchers and practitioners are identified.

However, a dearth of studies exploring code smells either theoretically or empirically suggests that there are reasons why smell eradication is neither being applied in anger, nor the subject of significant research. In this paper, we present three studies as supporting evidence for this claim. The first is an analysis of a set of five, open-source Java systems, the second an empirical study of a sub-system of a proprietary, C# web-based application and the third, a theoretical enumeration of smell-related refactorings. Key findings of the study were first, that developers seemed to avoid eradicating superficially 'simple' smells in favor of more 'obscure' ones; second, a wide range of conflicts and anomalies soon emerged when trying to identify smelly code. Finally, perceived effort to eradicate a smell may be a key factor. The study highlights the need for a clearer research strategy on the issue of code smells and all aspects of their identification and measurement.},

	Abstract = {Code smells are anomalous program structures that may indicate software maintainability problems. God Classes and Feature Envies are examples of code smells that frequently become the target of software refactoring. However, smell identification might be harder than expected due to the subjectivity involved in the recognition of the apparently simple structure of each smell. Moreover, smell identification might require the knowledge of multiple program elements, which are better understood by different developers. Thus, the use of collaboration among developers may have the potential to improve effectiveness on smell identification. However, current knowledge, especially empirically developed and evaluated in the industry, is quite scarce. This paper reports an industrial case study aimed at observing how 13 developers individually and collaboratively performed smell identification in five software projects from two software development organizations. Our results suggest that collaboration contributes to improving effectiveness on the identification of a wide range of code smells. We also analyzed the factors contributing to such effectiveness improvement.},

We address this challenge with Panappticon, a lightweight, system-wide, fine-grained event tracing system for Android that automatically identifies critical execution paths in user transactions. Panappticon monitors the application, system, and kernel software layers and can identify performance problems stemming from application design flaws, underpowered hardware, and harmful interactions between apparently unrelated applications.

	Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between faults and five of Fowler et al.'s least-studied smells in code: Data Clumps, Switch Statements, Speculative Generality, Message Chains, and Middle Man. We developed a tool to detect these five smells in three open-source systems: Eclipse, ArgoUML, and Apache Commons. We collected fault data from the change and fault repositories of each system. We built Negative Binomial regression models to analyse the relationships between smells and faults and report the McFadden effect size of those relationships. Our results suggest that Switch Statements had no effect on faults in any of the three systems; Message Chains increased faults in two systems; Message Chains which occurred in larger files reduced faults; Data Clumps reduced faults in Apache and Eclipse but increased faults in ArgoUML; Middle Man reduced faults only in ArgoUML, and Speculative Generality reduced faults only in Eclipse. File size alone affects faults in some systems but not in all systems. Where smells did significantly affect faults, the size of that effect was small (always under 10 percent). Our findings suggest that some smells do indicate fault-prone code in some circumstances but that the effect that these smells have on faults is small. Our findings also show that smells have different effects on different systems. We conclude that arbitrary refactoring is unlikely to significantly reduce fault-proneness and in some cases may increase fault-proneness.},

The answer is that the vehicles are all powered by fuel cells. Once confined to the realms of science fiction, the full commercialization of fuel cells could be just around the corner. Computational chemistry techniques, in particular molecular modeling and simulation, are being used to understand and refine the science driving this quiet, green revolution. Fuel cells were invented in 1839 by Sir William Grove, a Welsh judge and gentleman scientist, as a result of his experiments on the electrolysis of water.

To address these problems, we conducted a large empirical study over the software change history of 318 open source projects and investigated platform-dependent code changes from open source projects. Our analysis focuses on what types of changes mobile application developers typically make and how they perceive, recall, and communicate changed and affected code. Our study required the development of an automated strategy to examine open source repositories and categorize platform-related refactoring edits, bug repairs, and API updates, mining 1,961,990 commit changes.

	Abstract = {To improve the quality of software systems, one of the widely used techniques is refactoring, defined as the process of improving the design of an existing system by changing its internal structure without altering the external behavior. The majority of existing refactoring works do not consider the impact of recommended refactorings on the quality of future releases of a system. In this paper, we propose to combine the use of search-based software engineering with time series to recommend good refactoring strategies in order to manage technical debt. We used a multi-objective algorithm to generate refactoring solutions that maximize the correction of important quality issues and minimize the effort. For these two fitness functions, we adapted time series forecasting to estimate the impact of the generated refactorings solution on future next releases of the system by predicting the evolution of the remaining code smells in the system, after refactoring, using different quality metrics. We evaluated our approach on one industrial project and a benchmark of 4 open source systems. The results confirm the efficiency of our technique to provide better refactoring management comparing to several existing refactoring techniques.},

The resulting patterns can then be used to detect anomalies such as "Before calling next, one normally calls hasNext". To our knowledge, this is the first fully automatic defect detection approach that learns and checks methodcall sequences.

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a quantitative metric to analyze potential reusability of a Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) process. The approach is based on the description and logic mismatch probability of a BPEL process that will be reused within potential contexts. The mismatch probabilities have been consolidated to a metric formula for quantifying the probability of potential reuse of BPEL processes. An initial empirical evaluation suggests that the proposed metric properly predicts potential reusability of BPEL processes. According to the experiment, there exists a significant statistical correlation between the results of the metric and the experts' judgments. This indicates predictive dependence between the proposed metric and the potential reusability of BPEL processes as a measuring stick for this phenomenon. If future studies ascertain these findings by replicating this experiment, the practical implications of such a metric are early detection of the design flaws and aiding architects to judge various design alternatives.},

	Abstract = {Light intensity, duration, direction, and wavelength are informative to plants. The biochemical circuits that connect specific light wavelengths to expression of specific genes and the metabolic networks they govern have been well defined. However, little emphasis has been placed on how discrete wavelengths of light, alone or in combination, may be applied to manipulate postharvest qualities of high-value horticultural crops. Using narrow-bandwidth LED light we test the hypothesis that discrete light wavelengths can affect the accumulation of volatile compounds known to affect aroma or taste in select flower and fruit products. Volatile benzenoid/phenylpropanoid emission from petunia flowers could be altered with light application. Levels of a key floral volatile, 2-phenylethanol, increased with a red and far-red light treatment. Similar experiments demonstrated that fruit volatile profiles of tomato, strawberry, and blueberry can be manipulated with specific light treatments. These results suggest that compounds affecting sensory qualities of flowers and fruits can be modified by adjustment of ambient light conditions. These findings open new areas of inquiry about how the fragrance and flavor of flowers and fruits may be improved with simple changes in postharvest light conditions.},

	Abstract = {Behavior modeling has proved to be successful in helping uncover design flaws of concurrent and distributed systems. Nevertheless, it has not had a widespread impact on practitioners because model construction remains a difficult task and because the benefits of behavior analysis appear at the end of the model construction effort. In contrast, scenario-based specifications have a wide acceptance in industry and are well suited for developing first approximations of intended behavior; however, they are still maturing with respect to rigorous semantics and analysis tools.This article proposes a process for elaborating system behavior that exploits the potential benefits of behavior modeling and scenario-based specifications yet ameliorates their shortcomings. The concept that drives the elaboration process is that of implied scenarios. Implied scenarios identify gaps in scenario-based specifications that arise from specifying the global behavior of a system that will be implemented component-wise. They are the result of a mismatch between the behavioral and architectural aspects of scenario-based specifications. Due to the partial nature of scenario-based specifications, implied scenarios need to be validated as desired or undesired behavior. The scenario specifications are then updated accordingly with new positive or negative scenarios. By iteratively detecting and validating implied scenarios, it is possible to incrementally elaborate the behavior described both in the scenario-based specification and models. The proposed elaboration process starts with a message sequence chart (MSC) specification that includes basic, high-level and negative MSCs. Implied scenario detection is performed by synthesis and automated analysis of behavior models. The final outcome consists of four artifacts: (1) an MSC specification that has been evolved from its original form to cover important aspects of the concurrent nature of the system that were under-specified or absent in the original specification, (2) a behavior model that captures the component structure of the system that, combined with (3) a constraint model and (4) a property model that provides the basis for modeling and reasoning about system design.},

	Abstract = {Now that multicore processors are commonplace, developing parallel software has escaped the confines of high-performance computing and enters the mainstream. The Fork/Join framework, for instance, is part of the standard Java platform since version 7. Fork/Join is a high-level parallel programming model advocated to make parallelizing recursive divide-and-conquer algorithms particularly easy. While, in theory, Fork/Join is a simple and effective technique to expose parallelism in applications, it has not been investigated before whether and how the technique is applied in practice. We therefore performed an empirical study on a corpus of 120 open source Java projects that use the framework for roughly 362 different tasks.
On the one hand, we confirm the frequent use of four best-practice patterns (Sequential Cutoff, Linked Subtasks, Leaf Tasks, and avoiding unnecessary forking) in actual projects. On the other hand, we also discovered three recurring anti-patterns that potentially limit parallel performance: sub-optimal use of Java collections when splitting tasks into subtasks as well as when merging the results of subtasks, and finally the inappropriate sharing of resources between tasks. We document these anti-patterns and study their impact on performance.},

Objectifs
Ce travail propose l'{\'e}tude des descriptions des ph{\'e}nom{\`e}nes de demi-conscience ou de double conscience au dix-neuvi{\`e}me si{\`e}cle en France, et l'analyse des enjeux {\'e}pist{\'e}mologiques et anthropologiques qui les traversent.
M{\'e}thode
Une reprise de la litt{\'e}rature de l'{\'e}poque contient plusieurs types de descriptions : des auto-observations, telles celles de Jacques Joseph Moreau de Tours exp{\'e}rimentant les effets du haschich sur lui-m{\^e}me pour en faire le r{\'e}cit, se d{\'e}doublant ainsi car d{\'e}crivant consciemment la modification de sa conscience. D'autres, tel Maury, {\'e}tudient leurs r{\^e}ves en se faisant aider par des tiers qui doivent les r{\'e}veiller en plein sommeil, ou bien cherchent {\`a} influencer leurs r{\^e}ves par des odeurs ou des sons. D'autres descriptions portent enfin sur l'observation de modifications d'{\'e}tats de conscience chez autrui (Azam d{\'e}crivant la double personnalit{\'e} de F{\'e}lida).
R{\'e}sultats
Moreau de Tours d{\'e}crit l'auto-observation d'une manie « exp{\'e}rimentale » sous haschich, manie partiellement consciente d'elle-m{\^e}me. La « d{\'e}sagr{\'e}gation » de sa conscience lui permet de dire que certains ali{\'e}n{\'e}s sont capables, sans recours au haschich, de s'auto-observer d'une m{\^e}me fa{\c c}on (une partie « saine » observant la partie « malade »). Richet poursuit les travaux de son ma{\^\i}tre et oppose des « facult{\'e}s volontaires » {\`a} des « facult{\'e}s inconscientes ». Maury {\'e}tudie, quant {\`a} lui, ses propres productions hypnagogiques, ou « r{\^e}vasseries » pour consid{\'e}rer le r{\^e}ve comme analogue {\`a} l'hallucination et au d{\'e}lire, et d{\'e}crit des automatismes c{\'e}r{\'e}braux irr{\'e}pressibles. Il {\'e}voque {\'e}galement des instincts, refoul{\'e}s par la volont{\'e} pendant les phases de veille, lesquels r{\'e}appara{\^\i}traient dans les phases de r{\^e}ve. Hervey de Saint-Denys, quant {\`a} lui, privil{\'e}gie ses propres r{\^e}ves accompagn{\'e}s de la conscience de r{\^e}ver. Il d{\'e}crit comment, au cours m{\^e}me de son r{\^e}ve, il peut {\^e}tre capable de le diriger et, par exemple, de reproduire le m{\^e}me r{\^e}ve, par retour en arri{\`e}re, alors m{\^e}me qu'il dort.
Discussion
Les {\'e}tudes sur les modifications de la conscience posent de multiples questions et suscitent de nombreux d{\'e}bats au 19e si{\`e}cle. Tout d'abord, elles ouvrent sur deux conceptions oppos{\'e}es de l'individu. Une premi{\`e}re, celle de l'{\'e}cole spiritualiste « cousinienne » postule l'unicit{\'e} et l'identit{\'e} du moi, tandis que l'autre, de Cabanis {\`a} Maury et Taine, pour simplifier, met l'accent sur l'auto-observation et l'observation d'{\'e}tats de demi-consciences et de doubles consciences. La question est {\'e}galement pos{\'e}e, notamment par Maury, du statut des connaissances du r{\^e}veur et de la m{\'e}moire qui se d{\'e}veloppe dans le sommeil. Maury soutient qu'un savoir oubli{\'e} {\`a} l'{\'e}tat de veille pourrait {\^e}tre rappel{\'e} en r{\^e}ve.
Conclusion
Les ph{\'e}nom{\`e}nes de demi-conscience et de double conscience interrogent l'identit{\'e} m{\^e}me du sujet et font entrevoir la possibilit{\'e} qu'il existe des savoirs oniriques insus (ou inconscients) {\`a} l'{\'e}tat de veille. Cela am{\`e}ne Taine {\`a} soutenir en 1870 une philosophie selon laquelle le moi n'est, somme toute, qu'une pluralit{\'e} d'{\'e}tats de conscience et qu'il n'a ni identit{\'e}, ni unicit{\'e}. Arthur Rimbaud, peut-{\^e}tre apr{\`e}s avoir lu Taine, affirme de m{\^e}me en 1871 « Je est un autre ».
Objective
This paper proposes to study the descriptions of the phenomena of half-consciousness and double consciousness during the nineteenth century in France, and to analyse the epistemological and anthropological stakes involved.
Method
A review of the literature of the period reveals several types of descriptions: self-observations, such as those of Jacques Joseph Moreau de Tours experimenting the effects of hashish on himself so as to be able to describe them, thus dedoubling himself because consciously describing the change in his consciousness. Others, such as Maury, studied their dreams assisted by a third person who must wake them during deep sleep, or attempt to influence their dreams with smells or sounds. Finally, other descriptions concern the observation of modifications of states of consciousness in others (Azam describing the double personality of F{\'e}lida).
Results
Moreau de Tours described the self-observation of an ``experimental'' mania under hashish and partially conscious of it. The ``disaggregation'' of his consciousness allowed him to claim that certain alienated people are capable, without using hashish, to self-observe themselves in the same way (a ``healthy'' part observing the ``sick'' part). Richet pursued the works of his master and opposed ``voluntary faculties'' to ``unconscious faculties''. As for Maury, he studied his own hypnagogic productions or ``day dreams'', considering the latter as analogical to hallucination and delirium, and described irrepressible cerebral automatisms. He also evoked instincts, repressed by one's will during the phases of wakefulness, which would reappear during the phases of dreaming. Hervey de Saint-Denys privileged his own dreams accompanied by the consciousness of dreaming. He described how, while actually dreaming, he was capable of directing the dream, for example, by reproducing the same dream through recall, even while sleeping.
Discussion
The studies on the modifications in consciousness raised many questions and much debate during the nineteenth century. To start with, two opposing conceptions of the individual opened up. The first, that of Cousin's spiritual philosophy that postulated the unicity and identity of the ego, whereas the other, from Cabanis to Maury and Taine, placed to simplify the accent on the self-observation and observation of states of semi-consciousness and double consciousness. The question was also raised, notably by Maury, of the status of knowledge of the dreamer and of the memory that develops during sleep. Maury upheld that forgotten knowledge during the state of wakefulness could be recalled while dreaming.
Conclusion
The phenomena of half-consciousness and double consciousness question the identity of the subject him/herself and lead one to see the possibility that unknown or subconscious oniric knowledge exists during the state of wakefulness. This led Taine in 1870 to defend a philosophy in which the ego is only in fact a plurality of conscious states and that it has neither identity nor unicity. Arthur Rimbaud himself, perhaps after reading Taine, confirmed the same in 1871; ``I is someone else''.},

	Abstract = {Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) aims to improve software modularity, although developers can unwittingly introduce code smells in their programs. A code smell is any symptom in the source code that possibly indicates a deeper modularity problem. Several works have been concerned about code smell occurrences in aspect-oriented systems. However, there is little knowledge about their actual damage to the modularity of architectural designs. This gap makes it difficult for developers understand and manage the harmful architecture-level impact of recurring code smells. This paper presents an exploratory analysis that investigates the influence of aspect-oriented code smells on evolving architectural designs. We analyzed code smell occurrences in 14 versions of 2 applications designed using different architectural styles. The outcome of our evaluation suggests that code smell occurrences often entail architecture modularity problems in these systems. Even worse, our analysis revealed that certain architecturally-relevant code smells were not targeted by the refactoring strategies in place.},

	Abstract = {Context: The technical debt (TD) concept describes a tradeoff between short-term and long-term goals in software development. While it is highly useful as a metaphor, it has utility beyond the facilitation of discussion, to inspire a useful set of methods and tools that support the identification, measurement, monitoring, management, and payment of TD. Objective: This study focuses on the identification of TD. We evaluate human elicitation of TD and compare it to automated identification. Method: We asked a development team to identify TD items in artifacts from a software project on which they were working. We provided the participants with a TD template and a short questionnaire. In addition, we also collected the output of three tools to automatically identify TD and compared it to the results of human elicitation. Results: There is little overlap between the TD reported by different developers, so aggregation, rather than consensus, is an appropriate way to combine TD reported by multiple developers. The tools used are especially useful for identifying defect debt but cannot help in identifying many other types of debt, so involving humans in the identification process is necessary. Conclusion: We have conducted a case study that focuses on the practical identification of TD, one area that could be facilitated by tools and techniques. It contributes to the TD landscape, which depicts an understanding of relationships between different types of debt and how they are best discovered.},

	Abstract = {Awareness mechanisms are normally used to deliver context information to computer systems users. These mechanisms have been extensively studied as part of collaborative solutions designed for stationary scenarios, and recently on mobile and pervasive applications. The conventional awareness mechanisms through audio or visual messages have proved to be frequently unsuitable to deliver context information to people performing mobile activities, since the user's attention is not focused on the device he/she is using. This article presents two studies exploring the use of unconventional awareness mechanisms as a way to provide context information to firefighters during urban emergencies. In particular, the effectiveness of using the haptic and smell channels is evaluated as a way to implement direct and indirect capturers of the mobile workers' attention. The obtained results hint that both channels could be used to improve the information delivery. However, the awareness mechanisms that use the haptic channel are much more effective and allow implementing a more diverse set of messages. These awareness mechanisms can be used not only during emergency responses but also in other similar mobile work scenarios.},

	Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
This study examined how people classify plants in terms of their taste and smell, and how those organoleptic properties influence the differential use of medicinal plants for treating different diseases.
Methods
We conducted an ethnobotanical survey of household heads in the community of Sucruiu, located in Barreiras, Bahia, Brazil. The head of each family was questioned concerning their knowledge and use of medicinal plants, as well as the therapeutic indications (TIs), taste, and smell of each plant. We then tested for associations between the therapeutic indications and taste attributes of various plants using the Chi-squared test on a contingency table with Monte Carlo simulations. The same analysis was performed for associations between TIs and smell.
Results
The study participants provided more details when classifying tastes than when classifying smells. We considered only the most cited TIs and attributes, and found significant associations between both taste and therapeutic indications (p<0.001) and smell and therapeutic indications (p<0.0001).
Conclusions
Our results showed that the taste and smell of a plant can influence its differential medicinal use, since plants with certain tastes and smells prevailed in the treatment of distinct diseases. However, our results are valid only for the most popular TIs and organoleptic attributes.},

	Abstract = {Several code smells detection tools have been developed providing different results, because smells can be subjectively interpreted and hence detected in different ways. Machine learning techniques have been used for different topics in software engineering, e.g., design pattern detection, code smell detection, bug prediction, recommending systems. In this paper, we focus our attention on the classification of code smell severity through the use of machine learning techniques in different experiments. The severity of code smells is an important factor to take into consideration when reporting code smell detection results, since it allows the prioritization of refactoring efforts. In fact, code smells with high severity can be particularly large and complex, and create larger issues to the maintainability of software a system. In our experiments, we apply several machine learning models, spanning from multinomial classification to regression, plus a method to apply binary classifiers for ordinal classification. In fact, we model code smell severity as an ordinal variable. We take the baseline models from previous work, where we applied binary classification models for code smell detection with good results. We report and compare the performance of the models according to their accuracy and four different performance measures used for the evaluation of ordinal classification techniques. From our results, while the accuracy of the classification of severity is not high as in the binary classification of absence or presence of code smells, the ranking correlation of the actual and predicted severity for the best models reaches 0.88--0.96, measured through Spearman's ρ.},

In this paper, we present insights from an initial study of historical security incidents to analyse such factors for a particular class of CPS: industrial control systems (ICS). Our study challenges the usual tendency to blame human fallibility or resort to simple explanations for what are often complex issues that lead to a security incident. We highlight that (i) perception errors are key in such incidents (ii) latent design conditions -- e.g., improper specifications of a system's borders and capabilities -- play a fundamental role in shaping perceptions, leading to security issues. Such design-time considerations are particularly critical for ICS, the life-cycle of which is usually measured in decades. Based on this analysis, we discuss how key characteristics of future smart CPS in such industrial settings can pose further challenges with regards to tackling latent design flaws.},

	Abstract = {The object-oriented design is the most popular design methodology of the last twenty-five years. Several design patterns and principles are defined to improve the design quality of object-oriented software systems. In addition, designers can use unique design motifs which are particular for the specific application domain. Another common habit is cloning and modifying some parts of the software while creating new modules. Therefore, object-oriented programs can include many identical design structures. This work proposes a sub-graph mining based approach to detect identical design structures in object-oriented systems. By identifying and analyzing these structures, we can obtain useful information about the design, such as commonly-used design patterns, most frequent design defects, domain-specific patterns, and design clones, which may help developers to improve their knowledge about the software architecture. Furthermore, problematic parts of frequent identical design structures are the appropriate refactoring opportunities because they affect multiple areas of the architecture. Experiments with several open-source projects show that we can successfully find many identical design structures in each project. We observe that usually most of the identical structures are an implementation of common design patterns; however we also detect various anti-patterns, domain-specific patterns, and design-level clones.},

As mobile software applications operate in resource-constrained environments, guidelines to build energy efficient applications are of utmost importance. In this paper, we studied whether or not a set of best performance-based practices have an impact on the energy consumed by Android applications. In an experimental study with six popular mobile applications, we observed that the battery of the mobile device can last up to approximately an extra hour if the applications are developed with energy-aware practices.

	Abstract = {Infections with the bovine lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus, the causative agent of parasitic bronchitis, are accompanied by substantial economic losses due to impacts on production, clinical respiratory disease or even death of diseased cattle. To detect lungworm antibodies in cattle, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on recombinant major sperm protein (MSP) has been developed. However, it remained unknown whether the infection dose influences antibody levels, and how acquired immunity influences antibody level patterns during reinfections. The latter may lead to low within-herd seroprevalence and thus to negative MSP-ELISA results in examination of bulk tank milk (BTM). Thus, infection experiments with 12 different doses ranging from 10 to 3000 D. viviparus larvae were performed to assess whether the antibody response is dose-dependent. Second, the impact of reinfections on the antibody response was evaluated in infection experiments, and third, antibody patterns in dairy cows during naturally occurring reinfections were assessed in a longitudinal field study based on individual milk samples. Results of this study demonstrate that the rise in MSP antibodies during first infection is dose-independent at infection doses of 25 lungworm larvae and above. However, following reinfections the magnitude and duration of the MSP antibody response are reduced or lacking, depending on the interval to reinfection. The field study revealed short periods of seropositivity as a common pattern in dairy cows subjected to natural D. viviparus reinfections. Low within-herd seroprevalence in dairy herds can thus be a result of continuous reinfections. Low infection doses should not be a barrier to serodiagnosis of lungworm infection in first-time infected cattle.},

	Abstract = {Rabbits handled around nursing time during the first week after birth show reduced fear response toward humans. Our earlier attempt to reduce the duration of daily treatment necessary to achieve this effect showed that even a minimal human contact, characteristic of animal caretaking in intensive rabbitries, results in reduced fearfulness. Being descendants of a nocturnal mammal species, olfactory cues are of central importance in rabbits, especially just after parturition, when the other sensory organs are undeveloped. In the present experiment, we investigated whether exposing newborn rabbit pups to human smell at nursing time is sufficient to reduce fear of humans in rabbits. For this, we exposed rabbit pups to one of the following handling treatments in the first week of life: (1) full handling, within 0.5h after nursing, which consisted of removing the pups from the nest and weighing them (about 5min/litter), (2) exposing rabbit pups to the smell of humans for about 5min/litter, without touching them, (3) untreated controls. At 28 days of age, the timidity of the pups was measured in a 5min approach test. Pups that were either handled or exposed to human smell appeared to be equally less fearful as they approached the experimenter's hand with a lower latency and more frequently than untreated controls. This indicates that olfactory exposure during handling results in imprinting even without a human contact in rabbits.},

	Abstract = {Traditionally, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was simply considered as a toxic and foul smelling gas, but recently H2S been brought into the spot light of cardiovascular research and development. Since the 1990s, H2S has been mounting evidence of physiological properties such as immune modification, vascular relaxation, attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammatory mitigation, and angiogenesis. H2S has since been recognized as the third physiological gaseous signaling molecule, along with CO and NO [65,66]. H2S is produced endogenously through several key enzymes, including cystathionine β-lyase (CBE), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST)/cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). These specific enzymes are expressed accordingly in various organ systems and CSE is the predominant H2S-producing enzyme in the cardiovascular system. The cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE)/H2S pathway has demonstrated various cardioprotective effects, including anti-atherosclerosis, anti-hypertension, pro-angiogenesis, and attenuation of myocardial ischemia--reperfusion injury. CSE exhibits its anti-atherosclerotic effect through 3 mechanisms, namely reduction of chemotactic factor inter cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and CX3CR1, inhibition of macrophage lipid uptake, and induction of smooth muscle cell apoptosis via MAPK pathway. The CSE/H2S pathway's anti-hypertensive properties are demonstrated via aortic vasodilation through several mechanisms, including the direct stimulation of KATP channels of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), induction of MAPK pathway, and reduction of homocysteine buildup. Also, CSE/H2S pathway plays an important role in angiogenesis, particularly in increased endothelial cell growth and migration, and in increased vascular network length. In myocardial ischemia--reperfusion injuries, CSE/H2S pathway has shown a clear cardioprotective effect by preserving mitochondria function, increasing antioxidant production, and decreasing infarction injury size. However, CSE/H2S pathway's role in inflammation mitigation is still clouded, due to both pro and anti-inflammatory results presented in the literature, depending on the concentration and form of H2S used in specific experiment models.},

	Abstract = {Detection and recognition of chemical cues from predators may lower the risk of predation in prey fish. Responses to particular cues in fish may be inherited or learned. In a laboratory experiment, we tested whether the coral-reef-dwelling goby, Asterropteryx semipunctatus, can learn to recognize a novel chemical cue and associate it with danger. Gobies were simultaneously exposed to a neutral chemical cue (the smell of a planktivorous damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus) and either conspecific skin extracts (which contains a chemical alarm cue) or skin extracts from the freshwater swordtail, Xiphophorus helleri. Swordtails, which are allopatric with A. semipunctatus, lack the goby alarm cue and were used to control for a general response to the damaged skin of any fish. Two days after the conditioning, the gobies were exposed to only the neutral chemical cue. Gobies that had been conditioned to the neutral cue paired with conspecific skin extracts on day 1 responded to the neutral cue alone on day 3 with a typical alarm response, including decreased movement and feeding. Gobies that had been conditioned to the neutral cue paired with swordtail skin extracts did not show an alarm response. These results suggest that A. semipunctatus can learn to recognize a novel chemical cue and associate it with danger after a single simultaneous exposure to a novel cue and a conspecific alarm signal. This mechanism of rapid learning of novel chemical cues may be an important way in which coral reef fish learn to recognize predators.},

	Abstract = {An analytical method for the quantification in wines of the strong-smelling compound, 1-octen-3-one, has been developed. 1-Octen-3-one is extracted by passing 90mL of wine through a solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge packed with 90mg of LiChrolut-EN resins. Wine major volatiles and potential interferences are removed by washing up with 9mL of a 40% methanol--water solution containing 1% NaHCO3. The ketone is subsequently derivatised with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine (PFBHA) to form its two isomeric oximes. Reaction takes place in the same cartridge at room temperature (25$\,^{\circ}$C) in 15min. The excess of reagent is then removed by washing with 20mL of a 0.05M sulphuric acid solution. The corresponding oximes are further eluted with pentane and determined by gas chromatography coupled with ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (GC--MS/MS) by non-resonant fragmentation of the m/z 140 parent ion and subsequent analysis of the corresponding daughter ions (m/z 77, 79, 94 for the trans and m/z 77 and 79 for the cis-isomer, respectively). The analytical signal is highly specific and in all samples the obtained MS spectrum are fully coincident with those from synthetic standards. Recoveries were in all the studied cases 100%. Precision (measured as R.S.D.) is better than 5%, linearity holds at least up to 900ngL−1 (r2=0.9990), and the method detection limit is 0.75ngL−1, well below the olfactory threshold of the compound (15ngL−1). The range of concentrations found in normal, non-spoiled dry wines goes from 7 to 61ngL−1. Sensory experiments have shown, however, that such differences do not seem to be enough to explain sensory differences.},

	Abstract = {Internet has emerged as a medium to connect entities across the world for emailing, conferencing, trading, gaming and so on. Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as a global network for connecting any objects (physical or virtual) across the globe, ranging applications from home appliances to consumer electronics. In IoT, physical objects such as home appliances, vehicles, supply-chain items, containers, etc. should have unique identities for interacting among themselves. As a result, unique identification of trillion of objects is a foremost requirement in IoT. RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology plays an important role in IoT for solving identification issues of objects around us in a cost effective manner. The usage of low cost RFID tags draws greater attention from researchers in recent past, as the cost of supply-chain items should not exceed much because of embedded tag cost. The communication between tag and reader takes place over insecure channel. Therefore, security concern has become an important issue in RFID systems. In recent years, several light-weight protocols and improvements have been proposed for RFID security. Some of them have succeeded with their security claim, but many protocols suffer from security weaknesses or design flaws. In this paper, we discuss a recently proposed protocol's strengths and weaknesses and then proposed an improved protocol, retaining efficiency of the protocol intact.},

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on comments described in Java programs, and conducts an empirical analysis about relationships between comments and fault-proneness in the programs. The types of comments analyzed in this paper are comments described inside a method body (inner comments), and comments followed by a method declaration (documentation comments). Although both of them play important roles in the program comprehension, they seem to be described in different purposes, The inner comments are often added to present tips about code fragments, while the documentation comments usually work as a programmer's manual. In the field of code refactoring, well-written inner comments are said to be related to "code smell" since they may cover a lack of readability in a complicated code fragment. This paper analyzes the associations of comments with the code quality from the aspect of fault-proneness, with using four popular open source products. The empirical results show that a method having inner comments tends to be 1.8 - 3.0 times likely to be faulty. The key contribution of this work is to reveal the usefulness of inner comments to point at faulty methods.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive Systems (ASs) can adapt themselves to achanging environment or new user needs. Monitors are essential in AS, being responsible for collecting and processing data from environment. There exist different kinds of monitors with distinct characteristics. Based on a literature review, we have noticed that Monitors are usually designed and implemented in an inadequate way: i) making them obscure in the source-code, ii) compelling all of them to have the same polling rate and also iii) predetermining the execution order among them. This leads to maintenance, evolution and performance problems. Besides, based on our observations, this erroneous way monitors are implemented follows a pattern and it is a recurrent practice. Therefore, we believe it can be classified as Monitor Smells of Adaptive Systems. In this paper we present two architectural smells we have identified: the Obscure Monitor and the Oppressed Monitors. The first smell occurs when the monitors are not evident in the source-code. The second smell occurs when monitors are compelled to have the same poling rate and an immutable execution order at runtime. The presence of these smells compromises the reusability, evolvability and maintainability. We have also conducted an exploratory study by comparing the impact of maintenance tasks in the original version of an AS called PhoneAdapter with a refactored version, in which the smells were removed. The results indicate the maintenance is facilitated in the version without the smells.},

	Abstract = {Media-rich content plays a vital role in consumer applications today, as these applications try to find new and interesting ways to engage their users. Video, audio, and the more traditional forms of media content continue to dominate with respect to the use of media content to enhance the user experience. Tactile interactivity has also now become widely popular in modern computing applications, while our olfactory and gustatory senses continue to have a limited role. However, in recent times, there have been significant advancements regarding the use of olfactory media content (i.e., smell), and there are a variety of devices now available to enable its computer-controlled emission. This paper explores the impact of the audio stream on user perception of olfactory-enhanced video content in the presence of skews between the olfactory and video media. This research uses the results from two experimental studies of user-perceived quality of olfactory-enhanced multimedia, where audio was present and absent, respectively. Specifically, the paper shows that the user Quality of Experience (QoE) is generally higher in the absence of audio for nearly perfect synchronized olfactory-enhanced multimedia presentations (i.e., an olfactory media skew of between {−10,+10s}); however, for greater olfactory media skews (ranging between {−30s;−10s} and {+10s, +30s}) user QoE is higher when the audio stream is present. It can be concluded that the presence of the audio has the ability to mask larger synchronization skews between the other media components in olfaction-enhanced multimedia presentations.},

	Abstract = {We design a survey to provide quantitative evidence about household demand for qualitative aspects of tap water supply. We focus on two characteristics that are of importance for households: water hardness and aesthetic quality in terms of taste, smell and appearance. Our survey elicits expenditures on products that improve the overall experience of these characteristics of tap water quality, and administration targets a representative sample of the population in England and Wales. For water hardness, our results show that around 14% of households employ at least one water softener device or purchase products such as softening tablets or descaling agents. For the aesthetic quality of tap water, around 39% of households report some averting behaviour, the most common being the use of filtering devices, purchase of bottled water, or addition of squash or cordial. To study how expenditures on these products vary with the level of service quality, we match household data to highly disaggregated records on regional water hardness (in mg CaCO3/l) and aesthetic quality, as measured by the regional rate of complaints to the water service supplier. Our econometric analysis suggests that households' decision to incur averting expenditures varies with service quality in a statistically and economically significant manner, providing novel evidence that households actively respond to non-health related aspects of tap water quality.},

In this paper we explore the characteristics of Scratch programs. To this end we have scraped the Scratch public repository and retrieved 250,000 projects. We present an analysis of these projects in three different dimensions. Initially, we look at the types of blocks used and the size of the projects. We then investigate complexity, used abstractions and programming concepts. Finally we detect code smells such as large scripts, dead code and duplicated code blocks. Our results show that 1) most Scratch programs are small, however Scratch programs consisting of over 100 sprites exist, 2) programming abstraction concepts like procedures are not commonly used and 3) Scratch programs do suffer from code smells including large scripts and unmatched broadcast signals.},

This paper advocates the verification of logic controllers with a special focus on the following three issues: (a) the control code is given as a sequential function chart (SFC), a description language becoming increasingly popular for industrial controllers; (b) the cyclic operation mode of the hardware on which the controllers is implemented is taken into account; (c) specifications of the control logic that include timers and the real-time behavior of the controlled plant are considered. We propose an approach in which the SFC controller is first translated into a timed automaton using an algorithm that explores a special graph grammar. The automaton can then be composed with a timed automaton modeling the plant behavior, and model-checking of the composition reveals whether a given set of requirements is fulfilled. All steps of the procedure are illustrated for the example of a controlled evaporation system},

	Abstract = {When a software design decision has a negative impact on one or more quality attributes, we call it a design problem. For example, the Fat Interface problem indicates that an interface exposes non-cohesive services Thus, clients and implementations of this interface may have to handle with services that they are not interested. A design problem such as this hampers the extensibility and maintainability of a software system. As illustrated by the example, a single design problem often affects several elements in the program. Despite its harmfulness, it is difficult to identify a design problem in a system. It is even more challenging to identify design problems when the source code is the only available artifact. In particular, no study has observed what strategy(ies) developers use in practice to identify design problems when the design documentation is unavailable. In order to address this gap, we conducted a qualitative analysis on how developers identify design problems in two different scenarios: when they are either familiar (Scenario 1) or unfamiliar (Scenario 2) with the analyzed systems. Developers familiar with the systems applied a diverse set of strategies during the identification of each design problem. Some strategies were frequently used to locate code elements for analysis, and other strategies were frequently used to confirm design problems in these elements. Developers unfamiliar with the systems relied only on the use of code smells along the task. Despite some differences among the subjects from both scenarios, we noticed that developers often search for multiple indicators during the identification of each design problem.},

We investigate the impact of antipatterns on classes in object-oriented systems by studying the relation between the presence of antipatterns and the change- and fault-proneness of the classes. Due to increased complexities in the software development, there is huge need of testing process to be carried on in better way. Also as the computer systems are significant to our society in everyday life and are performing an increasing number of critical tasks, so more work in software testing and analysis has become of great importance. Anti pattern testing is type of testing which is used to cut off the directly price associated with testing of different modules. This paper discusses various anti pattern detection techniques and proposes a new testing technique based on GUI for detection of anti patterns during software development.},

	Abstract = {A completely randomized design was used to study the effect of castration at three months of age and fattening periods (2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months of fattening) on the feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of Fars native male goat kids. Six kids were slaughtered on the first day of the experiment (day 0), and 60 kids were divided into two groups (castrate or intact) of similar mean live weight, and housed in individual pens and fed a pelleted total mixed diet ad libitum. At the end of each fattening period, 6 kids per treatment were randomly selected for slaughter and evaluation of carcass quality. The mean live body weight for each fattening period between the castrate and intact groups was significantly different (P<0.01). However, the average daily gain (ADG), daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio (FCR) for each period between the two treatment groups did not differ. The mean live body weight, daily weight gains, daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio were however significantly affected by the fattening period. Dressing percentages after 2, 3 and 4 months of fattening were not significantly different between the castrate and intact groups, but significantly different after 5 and 6 months of fattening. The mean carcass lean and fat percentages during certain periods between the castrated and intact groups were significantly different, but the percentage bone in each period between the two groups was not significantly different. Overall, the mean carcass lean and fat percentages were significantly different between the intact (68.8% and 8.5%, respectively) and castrated (65.4% and 12.5%, respectively) animals. The mean carcass bone percentage was not significantly different between the intact (21.5%) and castrated (20.9%) animals. With castration, the internal fat and carcass fat content increased and carcass lean content decreased. As judged by a taste panel, meat from the castrated kids recorded a milder smell than meat from the intact males (P<0.05). Although the stress of castration had a negative effect on live body weight at the onset of the experiment, a fattening period of 3 months is recommended with castration, given the development of meat odour in goats slaughtered after longer fattening periods.},

	Abstract = {Unit testing represents a key activity in software development and maintenance. Test suites with high internal quality facilitate maintenance activities, such as code comprehension and regression testing. Several guidelines have been proposed to help developers write good test suites. Unfortunately, such rules are not always followed resulting in the presence of bad test code smells (or simply test smells). Test smells have been defined as poorly designed tests and their presence may negatively affect the maintainability of test suites and production code. Despite the many studies that address code smells in general, until now there has been no empirical evidence regarding test smells (i) distribution in software systems nor (ii) their impact on the maintainability of software systems. This paper fills this gap by presenting two empirical studies. The first study is an exploratory analysis of 18 software systems (two industrial and 16 open source) aimed at analyzing the distribution of test smells in source code. The second study, a controlled experiment involving twenty master students, is aimed at analyzing whether the presence of test smells affects the comprehension of source code during software maintenance. The results show that (i) test smells are widely spread throughout the software systems studied and (ii) most of the test smells have a strong negative impact on the comprehensibility of test suites and production code.},

	Abstract = {Detecting the taste components within a flavoured substance relies on exposing chemoreceptors within the mouth to the chemical components of ingested food. In our paper, we show that the evaluation of taste components can also be influenced by the tactile quality of the food. We first discuss how multisensory factors might influence taste, flavour and smell for both typical and atypical (synaesthetic) populations and we then present two empirical studies showing tactile--taste interactions in the general population. We asked a group of non-synaesthetic adults to evaluate the taste components of flavoured food substances, whilst we presented simultaneous cross-sensory visuo-tactile cues within the eating environment. Specifically, we presented foodstuffs between subjects that were otherwise identical but had a rough versus smooth surface, or were served on a rough versus smooth serving-plate. We found no effect of the serving-plate, but we found the rough/smoothness of the foodstuff itself significantly influenced perception: food was rated as significantly more sour if it had a rough (versus smooth) surface. In modifying taste perception via ostensibly unrelated dimensions, we demonstrate that the detection of tastes within flavours may be influenced by higher level cross-sensory cues. Finally, we suggest that the direction of our cross-sensory associations may speak to the types of hedonic mapping found both in normal multisensory integration, and in the unusual condition of synaesthesia.},

@article{VANDENBERG201659,
	Abstract = {Compared to ruminants little is known about how horses modulate food intake and learn about flavour-to-post-ingestive consequences. While it has been suggested that due to hindgut fermentation horse⿿s foraging preferences may be largely influenced by sensory input (e.g. volatiles), it has been established that horses are able to differentiate and select familiar foods (e.g. concentrates and hay) based on nutritional content. Yet it remains unclear how this translates to the acceptance of nutritious novel foods (NF). Therefore, the influence of food cues and nutrient composition on NF acceptance were examined in two experiments using 11 adult mares. In experiment 1, we investigated the influence of a familiar odour (FO) on the acceptance of a nutritious NF and in experiment 2, we determined if horses have the ability to select nutritious NF based on the nutritional content, regardless of sensory preferences. In experiment 1 horses received identical NF in a two-choice test with one of the choices being masked with a FO over a 9-day period. In experiment 2 horses were offered a high or low protein option of an otherwise identical NF in a two-choice test in which the NFs were paired with two unfamiliar flavours (odours). The two-choice test lasted for 14days and the flavour-protein pairing was switched after 7days. NF intakes were recorded over a 10min test period on each test day and analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models. The results of experiment 1 indicate that a FO had a strong positive influence on the NF intake for the first 5days (90⿿100% of total consumption and strong evidence for non-zero temporal effects (Bayes factor B12=110)). This was followed by a more even distribution of intake for the remaining period. In experiment 2 horses had a greater intake of high protein NF regardless of the flavour on days 4, 6 and 7 (80⿿87% of total consumption) and this continued after the switch over (Day 9⿿14; 57⿿81% of total consumption). However, 4 out of 11 horses showed neophobia throughout the testing period, which could have been associated with the novel odours as horses scanned the buckets with little to no sampling. The results suggest that pre-ingestive cues (e.g. smell, taste) of foods play an important role in diet selection and that a FO can increase the acceptance of NF. This new knowledge could be applied by the horse industry to encourage the consumption of new food or forages by horses.},

	Abstract = {Software systems tend to suffer from architectural problems as they are being developed. While modern software development methodologies such as Agile and Dev-Ops suggest different ways of assuring code quality, very little attention is paid to maintaining high quality of the architecture of the evolving systems. By detecting and alerting about violations of the intended software architecture, one can often avoid code-level bad smells such as spaghetti code.
Typically, if one wants to reason about the software architecture, the burden of first defining the intended architecture falls on the developer's shoulders. This includes definition of valid and invalid dependencies between software components. However, the developers are seldom familiar with the entire software system, which makes this task difficult, time consuming and error-prone.
We propose and implement a solution for automatic detection of architectural violations in software artifacts. The solution, which utilizes a number of predefined and user-defined patterns, does not require prior knowledge of the system or its intended architecture. We propose to leverage this solution as part of the nightly build process used by development teams, thus achieving continuous automatic validation of the system's software architecture. As we show in multiple open-source and proprietary cases, a small set of predefined patterns can detect architectural violations as they are introduced over the course of development, and also capture deterioration in existing architectural problems. By evaluating the tool on relatively large open-source projects, we also validate its scalability and practical applicability to large software systems.},

	Abstract = {Android code smells are bad implementation practices within Android applications (or apps) that may lead to poor software quality, in particular in terms of performance. Yet, performance is a main software quality concern in the development of mobile apps. Correcting Android code smells is thus an important activity to increase the performance of mobile apps and to provide the best experience to mobile end-users while considering the limited constraints of mobile devices (e.g., CPU, memory, battery). However, no empirical study has assessed the positive performance impacts of correcting mobile code smells. In this paper, we therefore conduct an empirical study focusing on the individual and combined performance impacts of three Android performance code smells (namely, Internal Getter/Setter, Member Ignoring Method, and HashMap Usage) on two open source Android apps. To perform this study, we use the Paprika toolkit to detect these three code smells in the analyzed apps, and we derive four versions of the apps by correcting each detected smell independently, and all of them. Then, we evaluate the performance of each version on a common user scenario test. In particular, we evaluate the UI and memory performance using the following metrics: frame time, number of delayed frames, memory usage, and number of garbage collection calls. Our results show that correcting these Android code smells effectively improve the UI and memory performance. In particular, we observe an improvement up to 12.4% on UI metrics when correcting Member Ignoring Method and up to 3.6% on memory-related metrics when correcting the three Android code smells. We believe that developers can benefit from these results to guide their refactoring, and thus improve the quality of their mobile apps.},

	Abstract = {DeVoe and House (2012; Experiment 3) demonstrated that the process of thinking about one's income in relation to time (i.e., as an hourly wage) affected the enjoyment that participants derived from pleasurable experiences. Participants compelled to think of ``time is money'' experienced more impatience and less enjoyment in reaction to listening to a pleasurable piece of music compared to participants not asked to think of time as money. These effects were attenuated when participants were financially compensated for this leisure time. This suggests that putting a price on time can influence enjoyment of leisure activities, depending on the degree to which individuals are compensated for engaging in these activities. To determine the reliability, and magnitude, of the reported effects, two preregistered high-powered close replications were conducted. These independent replication attempts, as well as the analyses on the combined sample, failed to replicate the original pattern of findings.

	Abstract = {One consequence of experiencing flavour --- the combination of taste, smell and somatosensation that occurs during ingestion --- is that it can result in perceptual changes for the odour component, when this is later smelled alone. One such change is the acquisition of taste-like properties, but whether odours can also acquire somatosensory-like qualities is largely unknown. Participants here were exposed to one odour sampled in a viscous solution, another sampled in a sweet/viscous solution, and a further odour sampled in water. The odour sampled in the sweet/viscous solution was, when later sniffed alone, judged to smell thicker and sweeter, than the other two odours. Similarly, when the sweet/viscous paired odour was added to a viscous solution, the combination was judged as more viscous, than the other two odours --- and sweeter when added to a sweet solution. This experiment suggests that odours can acquire tactile-like somatosensory qualities and this may best occur when a taste is present during learning. Recent work indicates that tastes may be superior to somatosensory stimuli alone in promoting flavour binding, a seeming precondition for this type of learning.},

	Abstract = {Distillery effluent, a foul smelling, dark coloured by-product of distillery industries, is usually applied as irrigation water or as an amendment to arable land in some areas which are in the vicinity of the distillery industries. A field experiment on soybean--wheat system was conducted for 3 consecutive years in a Vertisol of central India to evaluate the effect of distillery effluent (DE) as an amendment on soil properties and crop productivity. The treatments were control (no fertilizer or manure or DE, T1), 100% NPK+FYM @ 4Mgha−1 to soybean (T2) and four graded levels of DE, viz.: 2.5cm DE to soybean and wheat on residual nutrition (T3), 2.5cm DE to soybean and 1.25cm to wheat (T4), 5cm DE to soybean and wheat on residual nutrition (T5), 5cm DE to soybean and 2.5cm to wheat (T6). The organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and electrical conductivity (EC) of the surface (0--10cm) soil increased significantly with application of DE compared to T1 and T2, but the soil pH was not affected. The EC increased from 0.47dSm−1 and 0.58dSm−1, respectively, in T1 and T2 to 1.52dSm−1 in T6, where highest dose of DE was applied. This indicated a slight build-up of salinity with DE application. The application of DE showed a significant improvement in the physical properties of the soil. The mean weight diameter (MWD), saturated hydraulic conductivity, water retention at field capacity and available water content were significantly (P<0.05) higher, while bulk density (BD) and penetration resistance of the surface soil were significantly lower (P<0.05) in all DE treated plots except in T3 than those in T1 and T2. The fractions of WSA of more than 1mm diameter in T6, T5 and T4 were, respectively, 141%, 107% and 116% more than the control. The MWD showed a positive linear relationship with the organic carbon (r=0.84**) and microbial biomass carbon (r=0.90**) of the soil. A significant (P<0.01) negative linear relationship (r=0.70**) was found between soil organic carbon and BD. Except T3, all the DE treated plots recorded significantly higher total and microporosity of the soil than control. Water retention at permanent wilting point and macroporosity of the soil were not affected by treatment. The seed yield of soybean in all the DE treatments was similar with T2 (1.86Mgha−1) but significantly more than control (1.28Mgha−1). The DE application levels have not affected the seed yield of soybean. In wheat highest grain yield was recorded in T2 (3.47Mgha−1), which was similar with T4 (3.16Mgha−1), T5 (3.22Mgha−1) and T6 (3.46Mgha−1). DE application up to T4 level was found suitable from productivity, salinity and sustainability point of view. The study showed that judicious application of DE as an amendment to the agricultural field could be considered as a viable option for safe disposal of this industrial waste.},

	Abstract = {While it is well documented that judges at times disagree on case outcomes, less understood is the process by which they justify their divergence. In this article, we empirically examine how judges differ in their view of the relevant law to a case. We create a unique dataset looking at the universe of published opinions in federal appellate court cases from the United States between 2001 and 2005 that include a dissenting opinion. We find that judges who disagree on the outcome of a case disagree as to which binding precedents apply. Authoring judges gravitate toward precedents that are ideologically similar to their own preferences. Precedents cited only by the majority are strongly ideologically correlated with the majority author's preferences; precedents cited only by the dissenting judge are ideologically similar to her preferences. Precedents cited by both the majority and dissent (i.e., precedent that both judges agree are relevant to the case before them) are not ideologically correlated with either judge. Our findings provide strong evidence that judicial differences over case outcomes do not reflect judges' divergent interpretations of the same precedent, but gravitation towards largely different precedent.},

	Abstract = {A code smell is any symptom in the source code that possibly indicates a bad design or programming problem. Many code smells in aspect-oriented programming (AOP) are very different from those in object-oriented programming. Therefore, new detection strategies should be conceived to identify whether a particular slice of aspect-oriented code is affected by a specific smell. Unfortunately, research on AOP usually focuses on providing abstract descriptions of code smells, without providing operational definitions of their detection strategies. Such strategies are becoming increasingly required due to the growing use of AOP in the development of long-living systems, including frameworks, libraries and software product lines. This paper presents a family of metric-based strategies that support the detection of recurring smells observed in existing aspect-oriented systems. We analyzed the accuracy of such smell detection strategies and also of those previously reported in the literature. Our study involved in total 17 releases of 3 evolving aspect-oriented systems from different domains. The outcome of our evaluation suggests that strategies for previously-documented AOP smells do not present a satisfactory accuracy. Our analysis also revealed that: (1) newly-discovered strategies achieved better results than well-known ones, and (2) the detection strategies seem to have high accuracy with respect to the identification of both trivial and non-trivial code smells.},

Group I (control) was fed with standard feed; groups II and III received the same feed supplemented with 150mg BHT or 500mg of a herbal extract mixture (sage, nettle, lemon balm and coneflower) per kg of feed, respectively. In each group, half of the animals received 4% rapeseed oil, the other half soybean oil. The herbal extracts had no effect on animal performance but significantly improved meat oxidative stability, lowered cholesterol and TI index and increased PUFA content in meat. Slight differences between animals fed with rapeseed or soybean oils were observed. Gilt meat had significantly better (P≤0.01) AI, TI, and h/H indices than barrow meat. It was concluded that herbal extracts have a beneficial effect on pork health-promoting properties due to changes in lipid fraction.},

	Abstract = {Much work has been done on the subject of what happens to software architecture during maintenance activities. There seems to be a consensus that it degrades during the evolution of the software. More recent work shows that this degradation occurs even during development activities: design decisions are either adjusted or forgotten. Some studies have looked into the causes of this degradation, but these have mostly done so at a very high level. This study examines three projects at code level. Three architectural pre-implementation designs are compared with their post-implementation design counterparts, with special attention paid to the causes of the changes. We found many negative changes causing anti-patterns, at the package, class, and method levels. After analysis of the code, we were able to find the specific reasons for the poor design decisions. Although the underlying causes are varied, they can be grouped into three basic categories: knowledge problems, artifact problems, and management problems. This categorization shows that anti-pattern causes are varied and are not all due to the developers. The main conclusion is that promoting awareness of anti-patterns to developers is insufficient to prevent them since some of the causes escape their grasp.},

	Abstract = {Code smells are often considered as key indicators of software quality degradation. If code smells are not systematically removed from a program, its continuous degradation may lead to either major maintenance effort or the complete redesign of the system. For several reasons, software developers introduce smells in their code as soon as they start to learn programming. If novice developers are ought to become either proficient programmers or skilled code reviewers, they should be early prepared to effectively identify code smells in existing programs. However, effective identification of code smells is often not a non-trivial task in particular to a novice developer working in isolation. Thus, the use of collaborative practices may have the potential to support developers in improving their effectiveness on this task at their early stages of their careers. These practices offer the opportunity for two or more developers analyzing the source code together and collaboratively reason about potential smells prevailing on it. Pair Programming (PP) and Coding Dojo Randori (CDR) are two increasingly adopted practices for improving the effectiveness of developers with limited or no knowledge in software engineering tasks, including code review tasks. However, there is no broad understanding about the impact of these collaborative practices on the effectiveness of code smell identification. This paper presents a controlled experiment involving 28 novice developers, aimed at assessing the effectiveness of collaborative practices in the identification of code smells. We compared PP and CDR with solo programming in order to better distinguish their impact on the effective identification of code smells. Our study is also the first in the literature to observe how novice developers work individually and together to identify smells. Our results suggest that collaborative practices contribute to the effectiveness on the identification of a wide range of code smells. Our findings can also be used in practice to guide educators, researchers or teams on improving detection and training on code smell identification.},

	Abstract = {Smart mobile devices are becoming the main vessel of personal privacy information. While they carry valuable information, data erasure is somehow much more vulnerable than was predicted. The security mechanisms provided by the Android system are not flexible enough to thoroughly delete sensitive data. In addition to the weakness among several provided data-erasing and file-deleting mechanisms, we also target the Android OS design flaws in data erasure, and unveil that the design of the Android OS contradicts some secure data-erasure demands. We present the data-erasure flaws in three typical scenarios on mainstream Android devices, such as the data clearing flaw, application uninstallation flaw, and factory reset flaw. Some of these flaws are inherited data-deleting security issues from the Linux kernel, and some are new vulnerabilities in the Android system. Those scenarios reveal the data leak points in Android systems. Moreover, we reveal that the data remanence on the disk is rarely affected by the user's daily operation, such as file deletion and app installation and uninstallation, by a real-world data deletion latency experiment. After one volunteer used the Android phone for 2 months, the data remanence amount was still considerable. Then, we proposed DataRaider for file recovering from disk fragments. It adopts a file-carving technique and is implemented as an automated sensitive information recovering framework. DataRaider is able to extract private data in a raw disk image without any file system information, and the recovery rate is considerably high in the four test Android phones. We propose some mitigation for data remanence issues, and give the users some suggestions on data protection in Android systems.},

	Abstract = {Learning has always been one of the core mechanics in computer games. Players learn specific battle mechanics, control schemes, and much more, which enables them to progress further through the game and experience pleasure. Previous studies on learning often focused on the learning of predictors (cues) for reward and their motivational properties, but fail to address the impact on pleasure. For example, the cue of a smell of chocolate will already produce a pleasure feeling, which means that apart from the motivational learning of the smell cue, something affected pleasure generation as well. In this paper, we perform an experimental study to investigate this relation of learning and pleasure. The study, in which 38 test subjects participated, used smile reactions to rewards of showing funny pictures as a primary measure of pleasure. The findings of the study demonstrate that experiment repetition leads to an increase in pleasure at the cue, a decrease in pleasure at the reward, and a potential relation between motivation and pleasure change at the cue.},

We aim to compare the results of using two smell measurement tools (DECOR which is embedded in the Ptidej tool and Stench Blossom) on the same Java code (ArgoUML). This comparison identifies the code each tool identifies as containing Message Chains. We evaluate the results from these two tools using human judgment on the smells that the code contains. We look in detail at how and why the results differ. Our results show that each tool identified very different code as containing Message Chains. Stench Blossom identified very many more code instances of Message Chains than DECOR. We found three reasons why these discrepancies occurred. First there are significant differences in the definitions of Message Chains used by each tool. Second, the tools use very different measurement strategies. Third, the thresholds embedded in the tools vary. This measurement inconsistency is a problem to practitioners as they may be applying refactoring ineffectively. This inconsistency is also a problem for researchers as it undermines the reliability of making cross study comparisons and prevents mature knowledge the impact of smells being developed.},

We focus on animals in the city by bridging the field with urban studies and open up for new design opportunities in terms of the possibilities of new digital technology to reconfigure animal city life. We present an ethnomethodological video analysis of the negotiations and interactional work between two leashed pugs and a handler walking down a street. We unpack similarities and differences between the two species in terms of their interests and intentions in an urban environment through detailed examination of the moments in the walk when the leash is pulled taut. We show how a strained leash can result from a conflict between the dog's attentiveness towards other dogs by smelling and looking, and the human's urge to move along. We propose design directions supporting the dogs' wants and needs by accessing the handler with information on the dogs' curiosities in other dogs by visualizing the invisible scent-universe of the dogs and encourage dog-dog interaction.},

	Abstract = {Objective
This study demonstrated statistical correlations between a novel self-administered odor questionnaire (SAOQ) and other olfaction tests in patients with olfactory disorders, and the usefulness of this questionnaire was discussed.
Materials and methods
Between December 2004 and November 2009 (5 years), the SAOQ was completed by 405 healthy people without any nasal diseases (Group A) and 539 patients with an olfactory disorder (Group B) at the Department of Otolaryngology, Hyogo College of Medicine. This was a prospective study. The SAOQ proposed by the Japan Rhinology Society is a self-administered survey consisting of 20 smell-related items: ``steamed rice, miso, seaweed, soy sauce, baked bread, butter, curry, garlic, orange, strawberry, green tea, coffee, chocolate, household gas, garbage, timber, stercus, sweat, flower, and perfume''. The normal reference range of scores (%) of the SAOQ was calculated in Group A. To determine whether the results of the SAOQ were correlated with those of visual analogue scale (VAS) and T&T olfactometer, pre- and post-treatment results of the SAOQ and olfaction tests were analyzed.
Results
The questionnaire response rates were 99.5% (403/405 people) in Group A and 95.9% (517/539 patients) in Group B. The statistically normal reference level of the SAOQ was determined as more than 70%. In Group B, the mean pre-treatment SAOQ score (20.4%), VAS score (16.5%), and T&T recognition threshold (5.0) significantly improved to values of 46.7%, 41.1%, and 4.1 after treatments, respectively (n=249). Both pre- and post-treatment SAOQ scores (ΔQ) had statistically significant relationships with those of VAS and T&T (n=249).
Conclusion
The utility of the SAOQ as an easy method of estimating olfaction was suggested.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this experiment was to determine if different methods of forage conservation influenced horse preference for conserved forages. Silage, haylage with two different dry matter (DM) levels and hay was produced from the same grass crop at the same botanical maturity stage. Four horses were simultaneously offered the four forages (1kg DM of each forage) once daily for four consecutive experimental periods, each period consisting of 5 days. On each experimental day, the horses were observed for 2h and their first choice, eating time and forage consumption was registered for every forage. The number of times each horse depleted individual forages and the number of times each horse tasted or smelled a forage, but left it in favour of another forage, was also recorded. Silage had the highest rate of consumption (0.90kgDM/day, S.D. 0.14) and longest eating time (28.4min/day, S.D. 5.16). Hay had the lowest rate of consumption (0.23kgDM/day, S.D. 0.14) and shortest eating time (6.8min/day, S.D. 4.08), while the haylages were intermediate. Silage was the first choice 72 of 84 times (85%). Hay was never completely consumed and silage was never left in favour of another forage after smelling or tasting it. We conclude that the forage conservation methods had an impact on horse preference in favour of silage, even if the reason for silage preference remains to be explained.},

We implemented a vibration-giving mechanism with an extremely simple structure based on a dynamic microphone and a dynamic speaker whose structures are almost identical. With this structure, Funbrella records the vibrations caused by raindrops and plays them. We implemented three applications: Crazy Rain, Tele-rain, and Minibrella.

	Abstract = {Background
Olfactory function is related to the scrutiny of environmental dangers and the tasting of food. However, olfactory dysfunction is not as distinctive as visual loss and may go unnoticed, especially when olfactory function deteriorates slowly. Most studies have used either questionnaires or relatively insensitive tests to assess olfactory dysfunction. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of olfactory dysfunction in Taiwan.
Methods
A total of 211 participants were recruited randomly from the community, factories or offices in Taichung City, Taiwan from April 2005 to March 2006. Age ranged from 19 to 89 years (mean age, 43.3 $\pm$ 12.7 years). All participants filled in questionnaires about sociodemographic data, self-rated olfactory function and impact on quality of life. The olfactory test was performed with identification task of the ``Sniffin' Sticks'' olfactory function test.
Results
The frequency of olfactory dysfunction in our series was 12.3%. There was a statistically significant difference in the ages of the normal and olfactory dysfunction groups (t test, p < 0.0001). The incidences of parosmia and phantosmia in the 211 participants were 10% and 30.8%, respectively. Most subjects did not rate their olfactory function well. There was no correlation between olfactory function and self-ratings of impact of olfactory function on quality of life.
Conclusion
Our present results provide preliminary data and clinical experience regarding the frequency of olfactory dysfunction in Taiwan. Future modifications and suggestions for the study of the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction are also mentioned.},

	Abstract = {Objectives
To explore the relationship between past year physical or sexual partner violence against women and women's self-report of sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms in post-revolution Egypt; and to examine the effects of men's and women's risky sexual behavioural characteristics and structural dimensions of poverty and gender inequality on this relationship.
Study design
This study uses the nationally representative cross-sectional demographic and health survey data conducted in 2014. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between past year partner violence and self-report of STI symptoms among currently married women.
Main outcome measures
women's self-report of STI was based on their responses to three questions; whether in the past year they had: got a disease through sexual contact?, a genital sore or ulcer?, or a bad smelling abnormal genital discharge? Women who gave an affirmative response to one or more of these questions were assumed to self-report STI.
Results
Almost one-third of women self-reported symptoms of STI. Fourteen percent of women reported they had experienced physical or sexual violence by a male partner in the past 12months. Abused women had a 2.76 times higher odds of self-reported STI symptoms (95% CI 2.25--3.38). The significant relationship between self-reported STI and past year partner violence against women did not alter when adjusting for men's and women's behavioural characteristics and factors related to poverty and gender inequality.
Conclusions
Public health interventions that address women's sexual and reproductive health need to consider violence response and prevention strategies.},

	Abstract = {The progressive insertion of code anomalies in evolving software systems might lead to architecture degradation symptoms. Code anomalies are particularly harmful when they contribute to the architecture degradation. Although several approaches have been proposed aiming to detect anomalies in the source code, most of them fail to assist developers when prioritizing code anomalies critical to the architectural design. Blueprints of the architecture design are artifacts often available in industry software projects. However, such blueprints are rarely explored to support the prioritization of code anomalies in terms of their architecture relevance. This paper proposes and evaluates 2 sets of blueprint-based heuristics for supporting the prioritization of critical code anomalies. The prioritization is based on their potential impact on revealing architectural drift problems. The heuristics allow developers prioritizing critical code anomalies by exploiting architectural information provided in the blueprint. The contributions of this paper include: (i) a set of architecture sensitive heuristics to support developers when prioritizing critical code anomalies; (ii) an evaluation of the proposed heuristics in terms of their prioritization accuracy in 3 systems; and (iii) an empirical analysis on how the blueprints' information might enhance the prioritization of critical code anomalies, as opposed to existing heuristics strictly based on source code analysis.},

@article{MASINI201070,
	Abstract = {Exposures to predator odors are very effective methods to evoke a variety of stress responses in rodents. We have previously found that ferret odor exposure leads to changes in endocrine hormones (corticosterone and ACTH) and behavior. To distinguish the contributions of the main and accessory olfactory systems in these responses, studies were designed to interfere with these two systems either independently, or simultaneously. Male Sprague--Dawley rats were treated with 10% zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), which renders rodents anosmic (unable to smell) while leaving the accessory olfactory areas intact, or saline, in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, the vomeronasal organs of rats were surgically removed (VNX) to block accessory olfactory processing, while leaving the main olfactory system intact. And in the third experiment both the main and accessory olfactory areas were disrupted by combining the two procedures in the same rats. Neither ZnSO4 treatment nor VNX alone reliably reduced the increased corticosterone response to ferret odor compared to strawberry odor, but in combination, they did. This suggests that processing through the main or the accessory olfactory system can elicit the endocrine stress response to ferret odor. VNX alone also did not affect the behavioral responses to the ferret odor. ZnSO4 treatment, alone and in combination with VNX, led to changes in behavior in response to both ferret and strawberry odor, making the behavioral results less clearly interpretable. Overall these studies suggest that both the main and accessory olfactory systems mediate the neuroendocrine response to predator odor.},

	Abstract = {Non-copulating (NC) males are those animals that do not mate in spite of repeated testing with sexually receptive females. They have been observed in several species including rats and mice. The present experiment was designed to perform a detailed behavioral characterization of NC male mice. Thus, we evaluated their sexual incentive motivation for a sexually receptive female or a sexually active male, olfactory preference for volatile and non-volatile odors from females or males, and olfactory discrimination between female and male volatile odors and food related odors (milk versus vinegar). We compared the activity of the accessory olfactory system (AOS) in copulating (C) and NC males in response to estrous bedding using the induction of Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) as a measure of neuronal activation. We also determined if estradiol or dopamine treatment could induce sexual behavior in NC males. Finally, we compared the testis weight and the number of penile spines in C, NC, and gonadectomized males. In the sexual incentive motivation test C males spend significantly more time in the female incentive zone than in the male incentive zone. On the other hand, NC males spend the same amount of time in both incentive zones. In tests of olfactory preference, NC males spent less time investigating estrous odors than C males. As well, NC males discriminate urine from conspecifics but they spend less time smelling these odors than C males. In addition, no increase in Fos expression is observed in NC males when they are exposed to odors from estrous females. Our data also suggest that the deficits observed in NC males are not due to lower circulating levels of gonadal hormones, because estradiol supplementation does not induce sexual behavior in these animals, and their testis weight and the number of penile spines are normal. The results suggest that NC males are not sexually motivated by the receptive females and their odors.},

These attacks stem from attacks on DHT routing, and are not mitigated by the well-known DHT security mechanisms due to a fundamental mismatch between the security requirements of DHT routing's put/get functionality and anonymous routing's relay selection functionality. Our attacks essentially allow an adversary that controls only a small fraction of the relays to function as a global active adversary. We apply these attacks in more detail to two schemes: Salsa and Cashmere. In the case of Salsa, we show that an attacker that controls 10% of the relays in a network of size 10,000 can compromise more than 80% of all completed circuits; and in the case of Cashmere, we show that an attacker that controls 20% of the relays in a network of size 64000 can compromise 42% of the circuits.},

Some approaches aim at detecting and fixing code anomalies, but they miss a deeper discussion about the introduction patterns and life cycle of such code anomalies. In this paper we analyze several projects to understand the incidence of code anomalies and their life cycle. In addition, we correlate code anomalies with some project characteristics and with other code anomalies. For example, we could observe that Shotgun Surgery and God Method anomalies never happen together. Moreover, we observed that Shotgun Surgery, God Package, and Misplaced Class anomaly life cycles are closely correlated.},

	Abstract = {Snippets of logging code are output statements (e.g., LOG.info or System.out.println) that developers insert into a software system. Although more logging code can provide more execution context of the system's behavior during runtime, it is undesirable to instrument the system with too much logging code due to maintenance overhead. Furthermore, excessive logging may cause unexpected side-effects like performance slow-down or high disk I/O bandwidth. Recent studies show that there are no well-defined coding guidelines for performing effective logging. Previous research on the logging code mainly tackles the problems of where-to-log and what-to-log. There are very few works trying to address the problem of how-to-log (developing and maintaining high-quality logging code). In this paper, we study the problem of how-to-log by characterizing and detecting the anti-patterns in the logging code. As the majority of the logging code is evolved together with the feature code, the remaining set of logging code changes usually contains the fixes to the anti-patterns. We have manually examined 352 pairs of independently changed logging code snippets from three well-maintenance open source systems: ActiveMQ, Hadoop and Maven. Our analysis has resulted in six different anti-patterns in the logging code. To demonstrate the value of our findings, we have encoded these anti-patterns into a static code analysis tool, LCAnalyzer. Case studies show that LCAnalyzer has an average recall of 95% and precision of 60% and can be used to automatically detect previously unknown anti-patterns in the source code. To gather feedback, we have filed 64 representative instances of the logging code anti-patterns from the most recent releases of ten open source software systems. Among them, 46 instances (72%) have already been accepted by their developers.},

	Abstract = {The construction of large-scale reference conceptual models is a complex engineering activity. To develop high-quality models, a modeler must have the support of expressive engineering tools such as theoretically well-founded modeling languages and methodologies, patterns and anti-patterns and automated supporting environments. This paper proposes a set of Ontological Anti-Patterns for Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling. These anti-patterns capture error-prone modeling decisions that can result in the creation of models that fail to exclude unintended model instances (representing unintended state of affairs) or forbid intended ones (representing intended states of affairs). The anti-patterns presented here have been empirically elicited through an approach of conceptual models validation via visual simulation. The paper also presents a series of refactoring plans for rectifying the models in which these anti-patterns occur. In addition, we present here a computational tool that is able to: automatically identify these anti-patterns in user's models, guide users in assessing their consequences, and generate corrections to these models by the automatic inclusion of OCL constraints implementing the proposed refactoring plans. Finally, the paper also presents an empirical study for assessing the harmfulness of each of the uncovered anti-patterns (i.e., the likelihood that its occurrence in a model entails unintended consequences) as well as the effectiveness of the proposed refactoring plans.},

	Abstract = {Software engineering has an increasing impact on the diverse products, services, and solutions offered by technology-oriented industries. For example, within SIEMENS AG over 60% of revenues depend on software. Consequently, failures in software development projects lead to significant costs. If software is so important, we need sustainable software architectures designed by well-educated and skilled software architects as backbone of high quality software systems.
However, due to the complexity of problem and solution domains and the increased desiderata of customers, software systems cannot be created in a big bang approach. Instead, software architectures must be systematically designed and then implemented using piecemeal growth which implies that software architects need to incrementally and iteratively refine, assess, and improve a software system. Otherwise, wrong or inefficient design decisions will be hard and costly to detect and eliminate inevitably causing design erosion to creep in.
Thus, Software Architecture Evaluation and Improvement play an important role in the development of sustainable software systems.
But how can we seamlessly integrate Software Architecture and Improvement into the architecture design process?
A systematic process for creating software architecture comprises among many other ingredients
the (stepwise) clarification and prioritization of requirements,
the incremental and iterative evolution of the software architecture driven by requirements and risks,
Continuous quality assessment for assuring that the software system meets its internal and external qualities as well as its functional expectations.
For continuous quality assessment Test-Driven Development and Design for Testability denote approaches that are applicable when the implementation is available. In order to assess the architecture itself, even in absence of a (full) implementation, qualitative and quantitative architecture assessment methods are available. For example, the experience-based industry review method applies a SWOT analysis to identify potential threats and weaknesses as well as potential means to resolve these issues. Architecture Analysis tools support software architects in this endeavor. But how can software architects improve the internal or external quality of the software system after they detected some architecture smells? It is essential to get rid of these issues by continuous software architecture improvement which exactly is the place where architecture refactoring, reengineering, and rewriting come in.},

	Abstract = {Code smells in a program represent indications of structural quality problems, which can be addressed by software refactoring. Refactoring is widely practiced by developers, and considerable development effort has been invested in refactoring tooling support. There is an explicit assumption that software refactoring improves the structural quality of a program by reducing its density of code smells. However, little has been reported about whether and to what extent developers successfully remove code smells through refactoring. This paper reports a first longitudinal study intended to address this gap. We analyze how often the commonly-used refactoring types affect the density of 5 types of code smells along the version histories of 25 projects. Our findings are based on the analysis of 2,635 refactorings distributed in 11 different types. Surprisingly, 2,506 refactorings (95.1%) did not reduce or introduce code smells. Thus, these findings suggest that refactorings lead to smell reduction less often than what has been reported. According to our data, only 2.24% of refactoring changes removed code smells and 2.66% introduced new ones. Moreover, several smells induced by refactoring tended to live long, i.e., 146 days on average. These smells were only eventually removed when smelly elements started to exhibit poor structural quality and, as a consequence, started to be more costly to get rid of.},

By introducing this technology, we expect people to share their smell and taste experiences with their family and friends remotely. Sharing these senses are immensely beneficial since those are strongly associated with individual memories, emotions, and everyday experiences. As the initial step, we developed a control system, an actuator, which could digitally stimulate the sense of taste remotely. The system uses two approaches to stimulate taste sensations digitally: the electrical and thermal stimulations on tongue. Primary results suggested that sourness and saltiness are the main sensations that could be evoked through this device. Furthermore, this paper focuses on future aspects of such technology for remote smell actuation followed by applications and possibilities for further developments.},

	Abstract = {Background
Pills (tablets and capsules) are widely used to administer prescription drugs or to take supplements such as vitamins. Unfortunately, little is known about how much effort it takes Americans to swallow these various pills. More specifically, it is not known to what extent hard-to-swallow pills might affect treatment outcomes (eg, interfering with adherence to prescribed medications or causing clinical complications). It is also unclear which properties (eg, size, shape, or surface texture) Americans prefer or reject for their pills. To learn more about these issues, we interviewed a small group of individuals.
Methods
We invited individuals in waiting rooms of our tertiary health care center to participate in structured interviews about their pill-taking habits and any problems they have swallowing pills. We inquired which pill properties they believed caused swallowing problems. Participants scored capsules and pills of representative size, shape, and texture for swallowing effort and reported their personal preferences.
Results
Of 100 successive individuals, 99 participants completed the interview (65% women, mean age = 41 years, range = 23-77 years). Eighty-three percent took pills daily (mean 4 pills/d; 56% of those pills were prescribed by providers). Fifty-four percent of participants replied yes to the question, Did you ever have to swallow a solid medication that was too difficult? Four percent recounted serious complications: 1% pill esophagitis, 1% pill impaction, and 2% stopped treatments (antibiotic and prenatal supplement) because they could not swallow the prescribed pills. Half of all participants routinely resorted to special techniques (eg, plenty of liquids or repeated or forceful swallows). Sixty-one percent of those having difficulties cited specific pill properties: 27% blamed size (20% of problems were caused by pills that were too large whereas 7% complained about pills that were too small to sense); 12% faulted rough surface texture; others cited sharp edges, odd shapes, or bad taste/smell. Extra-large pills were widely loathed, with 4 out of 5 participants preferring to take 3 or more medium-sized pills instead of a single jumbo pill. Conclusions
Our survey results suggest that 4 out of 5 adult Americans take several pills daily, and do so without undue effort. It also suggests that half of today's Americans encounter pills that are hard to swallow. Up to 4% of our participants gave up on treatments because they could not swallow the prescribed pills. Up to 7% categorically rejected taking pills that are hard to swallow. Specific material properties are widely blamed for making pills hard to swallow; extra-large capsules and tablets are universally feared, whereas medium-sized pills with a smooth coating are widely preferred. Our findings suggest that health care providers could minimize treatment failures and complications by prescribing and dispensing pills that are easy to swallow. Industry and regulatory bodies may facilitate this by making swallowability an essential criterion in the design and licensing of oral medications. Such policies could lessen the burden of pill taking for Americans and improve the adherence with prescribed treatments.},

	Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) availability is a key factor influencing the yield of Brassica napus L. Thus, mineral fertilization is widely used to improve the quality and quantity of seeds. In this study, we conducted field experiments to determine the impact of nitrogen fertilization on B. napus pests, their parasitoids and plant diseases. The results showed that N treatment had an impact on the abundance of pollen beetles (Meligethes aeneus Fab.) and cabbage seed weevils (Ceutorhynchus obstrictus Marsh.) as well as dark spot disease (Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc.). Since pest abundance was not correlated with the flower and silique numbers, the feeding and oviposition sites, plant smell bouquets were analysed to determine potentially attractive or repellent volatile organic compounds. We detected 19 different compounds among which acetic acid and several lipoxygenase pathway products were emitted at higher levels from N-treated plants. Emission of a few other terpenoid compounds was correlated with the pest abundance in field conditions. Abundance of parasitoids of both pests was related to the host availability rather than to the fertilization treatment. Therefore, we suggest that plant chemical cues play a minor role in localization of hosts in close proximity to parasitoid. Dark spot disease levels decreased with increasing N availability, possibly reflecting enhanced emissions of acetic acid, a known antifungal volatile. This study demonstrates the effects of N fertilization on bud and flower volatile bouquets, which might play a role in B. napus insect pest host selection and in resistance to fungal plant diseases. Further studies are necessary to investigate the behavioural responses of insects to the changed volatile bouquets.},

	Abstract = {To date, horses have seemed capable of using human local enhancement cues only when the experimenter remains close to the reward, since they fail to understand the communicative meaning of the human as momentary local enhancement cue (when the human is not present at the moment of the animal's choice). This study was designed to analyse the ability of horses to understand, remember and use human-given cues in a delayed (10s) three-choice task. Twelve horses (experimental group) had to find a piece of carrot hidden under one of three overturned buckets after seeing the experimenter hide it. The results were then compared with those of a control group (twelve horses) that had to find the carrot using only the sense of smell or random attempts. At the beginning, the experimental horses made more correct choices at the first attempt, although they took more time to find the carrot. Later the same horses were less accurate but found the carrot in less time. This suggests that the value of the proximal momentary local enhancement cues became less critical. It seemed, in fact, that the experimental and control group had aligned their behaviour as the trials proceeded. Despite this similarity, in the second half of the trials, the experimental group tended to first approach the bucket where they had found the carrot in the immediately preceding trial. Our findings indicate that horses are capable of remembering the location of food hidden by the experimenter after a delay, by using the human positioned close to the target as valuable information. The same horses are also capable of changing their decision-making strategy by shifting from the accuracy inferred from human given cues to speed. Therefore, horses are able to decide whether or not to use human given-cues, depending on a speed-accuracy trade-off.},

	Abstract = {The interaction between the infill walls and the reinforced concrete (RC) frame members in the progressive collapse process was examined experimentally in this study. Two 1/3 scaled, four-bay, two-story RC frame specimens, one of which was featured without infill walls while the other with infill walls, were tested. The frame specimens were designed in such a way that the center column of the first story was missing, in order to simulate the failure of the structural component due to abnormal loads or design flaws. The frame specimens were quasi-statically pushed downward at the top of center column under displacement control to investigate the progressive collapse mechanism of the RC frames, with a focus on the effects of infill walls. Specifically, the physical quantities and phenomena of great interest in this study include the collapse resistance force and mechanism, strain variation and crack development in structural components, and local and global failure modes of the frames. The test results showed that the infill walls can provide alternative load paths for transferring the loads originally only supported by the beams, and thus, improve the collapse resistance capacity of the RC frame. The infill walls, however, may reduce the ductility of the RC frame and may change the failure mode of the frame. It is concluded that the infill walls may affect (i.e., either improve or impair) the performance of RC frames against progressive collapse in different aspects.},

@article{AUBRUN200481,
	Abstract = {Two complementary methods, field experiments and physical modelling in a wind tunnel, have been used to investigate the dispersion of tracer-gas released from the ventilation system of a pig barn, under near-neutral stability conditions. In both cases, concentration fluctuations were measured and the deduced statistical results were compared. The choice of data processing applied to the time series of concentration was motivated by special issues in the assessment of odour annoyances: ``where, how often, how long and how strong does it smell?'' These features were described by the mean concentration distribution, the intermittency factor, the persistence and the 90-percentile. The good agreement between field and wind tunnel data confirmed the ability to replicate in wind tunnel the unsteady properties of a dispersion process, if the unsteady turbulent behaviour of the atmospheric boundary layer was properly modelled. A parametrical study of the influence on the dispersion process of the ratio between the exhaust velocity from the stack and the wind speed was then performed in wind tunnel. The fundamental outcome was that the near-field dispersion process under neutral stability conditions, despite the strong influence of the building wake, was for the most part driven by the meandering behaviour of the plume and not so much by the diffusion process. This study was also focused on the influence of the averaging time on the statistical results. The scatter generated by using dimensionless averaging times 200<Ta*<400 (used during field experiments) instead of Ta*→∞ (averaging time to ensure reproducible statistic results) was quantified in the wind tunnel. A degree of representativity of the results obtained from short-term samples, compared to fully converged statistical results was therefore assessed.},

We have observed, however, that mashups tend to suffer from deficiencies that propagate as mashups are reused. To address these deficiencies, we would like to bring some of the benefits of software engineering techniques to the end users creating these programs. In this work, we focus on identifying code smells indicative of the deficiencies we observed in web mashups programmed in the popular Yahoo! Pipes environment. Through an empirical study, we explore the impact of those smells on end-user programmers and observe that users generally prefer mashups without smells. We then introduce refactorings targeting those smells, reducing the complexity of the mashup programs, increasing their abstraction, updating broken data sources and dated components, and standardizing their structures to fit the community development patterns. Our assessment of a large sample of mashups shows that smells are present in 81% of them and that the proposed refactorings can reduce the number of smelly mashups to 16%, illustrating the potential of refactoring to support the thousands of end users programming mashups.},

@article{EBERT201582,
	Abstract = {Most mainstream programming languages provide constructs to throw and to handle exceptions. However, several studies argue that exception handling code is usually of poor quality and that it is commonly neglected by developers. Moreover, it is said to be the least understood, documented, and tested part of the implementation of a system. Nevertheless, there are very few studies that analyze the actual exception handling bugs that occur in real software systems or that attempt to understand developers' perceptions of these bugs. In this work we present an exploratory study on exception handling bugs that employs two complementary approaches: a survey of 154 developers and an analysis of 220 exception handling bugs from the repositories of Eclipse and Tomcat. Only 27% of the respondents claimed that policies and standards for the implementation of error handling are part of the culture of their organizations. Moreover, in 70% of the organizations there are no specific tests for the exception handling code. Also, 61% of the respondents stated that no to little importance is given to the documentation of exception handling in the design phase of the projects with which they are involved. In addition, about 40% of the respondents consider the quality of exception handling code to be either good or very good and only 14% of the respondents consider it to be bad or very bad. Furthermore, the repository analysis has shown (with statistical significance) that exception handling bugs are ignored by developers less often than other bugs. We have also observed that while overly general catch blocks are a well-known bad smell related to exceptions, bugs stemming from these catch blocks are rare, even though many overly general catch blocks occur in the code. Furthermore, while developers often mention empty catch blocks as causes of bugs they have fixed in the past, we found very few bug reports caused by them. On top of that, empty catch blocks are frequently used as part of bug fixes, including fixes for exception handling bugs. Based on our findings, we propose a classification of exception handling bugs and their causes. The proposed classification can be used to assist in the design and implementation of test suites, to guide code inspections, or as a basis for static analysis tools.},

For detecting, diagnosing, and resolving performance and availability problems, an end-to-end view, i.e., traceability of requests starting on the (mobile) clients' devices, is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we propose an approach for end-to-end monitoring of applications from the users' mobile devices to the back end, and diagnosing root-causes of detected performance problems. We extend our previous work on diagnosing performance anti-patterns from execution traces by new metrics and rules. The evaluation of this work shows that our approach successfully detects and diagnoses performance anti-patterns in applications with iOS-based mobile clients.

We apply our approach at different levels of abstraction (i.e., method, class, package) and we detect fine grained changes (i.e., statements were added in a class, but no method was added there). Concept analysis is a technique that identifies entities that have the same properties, but it requires manual inspection due to the large number of candidates it detects.

To prevent such issues, it is important to control accessibility and aliasing of objects. Dynamic Ownership is an effective way to do so, but its owner-as-dominator discipline is too restrictive: objects are either accessible or not. We propose in this paper to control accessibility and aliasing with more flexibility using two mechanisms, filters and crossing handlers. We demonstrate the benefits of the flexibility offered by these mechanisms, and report on the adaptation of a Smalltalk web server with our approach. We conclude that our variant of dynamic ownership is flexible enough to accommodate an existing design, while at the same time constraining it enough to highlight design anomalies.},

The experiments were performed on scented and scentless populations at Panormo, Therisos and Lassithi on the North coast of Crete in the springs of 2007 and 2008. D. vulgaris inflorescences consist of a large spike (spadix) surrounded by a bract (spathe) that forms a floral chamber containing male and female florets, produce a powerful putrid scent and show a triphasic pattern of thermogenesis. The pattern began with a weak heating by the male florets during the night before opening, followed by appendix heating on the next day associated with scent production, and a more powerful male thermogenesis on the next night associated with insects trapped inside. Mass-specific thermogenesis of the scentless variety was identical to that in scented ones, but different insects were attracted. Beetles with a mean weight of 700mg show heat production rates around 5mW or 7mWg−1 at 25$\,^{\circ}$C. Discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) were observed calorimetrically at and below 24$\,^{\circ}$C, significantly depending in amplitude and frequency on the experimental temperature.},

	Abstract = {Negotiation diagrams are a model of concurrent computation akin to workflow Petri nets. Deterministic negotiation diagrams, equivalent to the much studied and used free-choice workflow Petri nets, are surprisingly amenable to verification. Soundness (a property close to deadlock-freedom) can be decided in Ptime. Further, other fundamental questions like computing summaries or the expected cost, can also be solved in Ptime for sound deterministic negotiation diagrams, while they are PSPACE-complete in the general case.
In this paper we generalize and explain these results. We extend the classical "meet-over-all-paths" (MOP) formulation of static analysis problems to our concurrent setting, and introduce Mazurkiewicz-invariant analysis problems, which encompass the questions above and new ones. We show that any Mazurkiewicz-invariant analysis problem can be solved in Ptime for sound deterministic negotiations whenever it is in Ptime for sequential flow-graphs---even though the flow-graph of a deterministic negotiation diagram can be exponentially larger than the diagram itself. This gives a common explanation to the low-complexity of all the analysis questions studied so far. Finally, we show that classical gen/kill analyses are also an instance of our framework, and obtain a Ptime algorithm for detecting anti-patterns in free-choice workflow Petri nets.
Our result is based on a novel decomposition theorem, of independent interest, showing that sound deterministic negotiation diagrams can be hierarchically decomposed into (possibly overlapping) smaller sound diagrams.},

	Abstract = {Based on an on-line survey using questionnaires, information on Belgian consumers (n = 907) regarding their understanding and attitude towards shelf life labels and dates was collected. 80.1% of the respondents were familiar with the terminology of the label use by and best before while 69.6% indicated to know the difference between the meaning of the two labels. Judging edibility of food products at home occurs mainly by a combination of checking visually and smelling (82.5%), followed by looking at the shelf life date (67.5%) or tasting (50.4%). About half of the consumers is aware of and appreciates the difference between the two labels during this judgment. Most of the consumers interpret shelf life labels and dates with some flexibility, with variation depending upon the type of food product under consideration. Overall, the share of consumers willing to eat expired refrigerated products was lower than for expired products stored at ambient temperature: 19.1% for refrigerated raw products (e.g. meat and fish); 34.7% for refrigerated ready-to-eat products (e.g. deli-meat, cheese products, smoked fish); 61.0% for canned products (e.g. conserves) and drinks (e.g. beer) and lastly 69.3% for other products generally stored at ambient temperature (e.g. bread, unopened UHT milk, chocolate, cereals). Differences linked to age and gender are discussed. The suboptimal understanding and application of the EU date label framework by consumers may lead on the one hand to increased food disease burden by consuming certain expired use by products allowing growth of pathogens. On the other hand discarding food at the shelf life data in case of a best before date contributes to food waste by consumers. A better understanding of the shelf life labels use by (referring to food safety) and best before dates (referring to food quality) by consumers should be promoted.},

	Abstract = {The two-way object choice paradigm has been used extensively in studies of animal cognition. The paradigm involves presenting two options, one rewarding and one nonrewarding, to a subject and allowing it to make a choice between the two, potentially by exploiting specific cues provided by the experimenter. Using the paradigm, we tested first whether Asian elephants, Elephas maximus, could use auditory and/or olfactory cues to find food. While elephants were unable to locate hidden food by following an auditory cue, they were capable of finding food when the cue was olfactory. The second part of the study involved providing the subjects with only olfactory information about one option before presenting them with a choice between two. In trials in which subjects were allowed to investigate only the nonrewarding option, they made choices by exclusion, either inferring the location of the rewarding option or simply avoiding the nonrewarding one. Elephants thus relied on olfaction to locate food and to exclude nonrewarding food locations, but failed to use auditory information (when it was the only cue presented) to do the same. This study represents important evidence of elephants using their sense of smell in a cognitive task.},

On test, participants reported that odours paired with milks perceived as being fattier (i.e. LFSW, HFUN, HFSW) were judged to smell fattier than they did prior to conditioning. In a further test, participants were asked to sample each of the four odours in a slightly fatty-sweet milk target. Odours previously paired with high-fat milks enhanced perceived fattiness of the target, whilst odours previously paired with sweetened milks enhanced perceived sweetness. These results were not well accounted for by participants' explicit knowledge of the odour-milk pairings and suggest that fat-like qualities may be acquired.},

	Abstract = {Antibodies to several Epstein--Barr virus (EBV)-encoded enzymes are observed in patients with different EBV-associated diseases. The reason for these antibody patterns and the role these proteins might play in the pathophysiology of disease, separate from their role in virus replication, is unknown. In this series of studies, we found that purified EBV deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) can inhibit the replication of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro and upregulate the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. It also enhanced the ability of natural killer cells to lyse target cells. The EBV dUTPase also significantly inhibited the replication of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes and the synthesis of IFN-γ by cells isolated from lymph nodes and spleens obtained from mice inoculated with the protein. It also produced sickness behaviors known to be induced by some of the cytokines that were studied in the in vitro experiments. These symptoms include an increase in body temperature, a decrease in body mass and in physical activity. The data provide a new perspective on how an early nonstructural EBV-encoded protein can cause immune dysregulation and produce clinical symptoms observed in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) separate from its role in virus replication and may serve as a new approach to help identify one of the etiological agents for CFS. The data also provide additional insight into the pathophysiology of EBV infection, inflammation, and cancer.},

Of these frequent CNVs, 77% are novel. In the 95 individuals analyzed, the two most diverse genomes differed by at least 9 Mb in size or varied by at least 266 loci in content. Approximately 68% of the 800 polymorphic regions overlap with genes, which may reflect human diversity in senses (smell, hearing, taste, and sight), rhesus phenotype, metabolism, and disease susceptibility. Intriguingly, 14 polymorphic regions harbor 21 of the known human microRNAs, raising the possibility of the contribution of microRNAs to phenotypic diversity in humans.

	Abstract = {The cross-modal interaction between vision and other senses is a key part of how we perceive the real world. Significant stimulation to hearing, sense of smell, taste or touch can reduce the cognitive resources the brain is able to allocate to sight, and thus limit what the Human Visual System (HVS) can actually perceive at that moment. Selective rendering is able to exploit such knowledge of the HVS, to render those parts of a virtual environment a viewer is attending to at a high quality and the rest of the scene at a much lower quality, and thus at a substantially reduced rendering time, without the viewer being aware of this quality difference. This paper investigates how the presence of the modalities of sound, smell and ambient temperature in a virtual environment significantly affects a viewer's ability to perceive the quality of the graphics used for that environment. Experiments were run with a total of 356 participants to determine the graphics quality thresholds across the different cross-modal interactions. The results revealed a significant effect of strong perfume, high temperature and audio noise on perceived rendering quality. Under given conditions, this particular combination of modalities can be thus exploited when rendering virtual environments, to substantially reduce rendering time without any loss in the user's perception of delivered visual quality.},

Based on a new understanding of the security risks introduced by the callback mechanism in system services, we have discovered a general type of design flaw. A vulnerability detection tool has been designed and implemented based on static taint analysis. We applied the tool on all the 80 system services in the SS of Android 5.1.0. With its help, we have discovered six previously unknown vulnerabilities, which are further confirmed on Android 2.3.7-6.0.1. According to our analysis, about 97.3% of the entire 1.4 billion real-world Android devices are vulnerable. Our proof-of-concept attack proves that the vulnerabilities can enable a malicious app to freeze critical system functionalities or soft-reboot the system immediately. It is a neat type of denial-of-service at-tack. We also proved that the attacks can be conducted at mission critical moments to achieve meaningful goals, such as anti anti-virus, anti process-killer, hindering app updates or system patching. After being informed, Google confirmed our findings promptly. Several suggestions on how to use callbacks safely are also proposed to Google.},

	Abstract = {JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages, yet it is known for its suboptimal design. To effectively use JavaScript despite its design flaws, developers try to follow informal code quality rules that help avoid correctness, maintainability, performance, and security problems. Lightweight static analyses, implemented in "lint-like" tools, are widely used to find violations of these rules, but are of limited use because of the language's dynamic nature. This paper presents DLint, a dynamic analysis approach to check code quality rules in JavaScript. DLint consists of a generic framework and an extensible set of checkers that each addresses a particular rule. We formally describe and implement 28 checkers that address problems missed by state-of-the-art static approaches. Applying the approach in a comprehensive empirical study on over 200 popular web sites shows that static and dynamic checking complement each other. On average per web site, DLint detects 49 problems that are missed statically, including visible bugs on the web sites of IKEA, Hilton, eBay, and CNBC.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a novel fruit fly optimization algorithm (nFOA) is proposed to solve the semiconductor final testing scheduling problem (SFTSP). First, a new encoding scheme is presented to represent solutions reasonably, and a new decoding scheme is presented to map solutions to feasible schedules. Second, it uses multiple fruit fly groups during the evolution process to enhance the parallel search ability of the FOA. According to the characteristics of the SFTSP, a smell-based search operator and a vision-based search operator are well designed for the groups to stress exploitation. Third, to simulate the information communication behavior among fruit flies, a cooperative search process is developed to stress exploration. The cooperative search process includes a modified improved precedence operation crossover (IPOX) and a modified multipoint preservative crossover (MPX) based on two popular structures of the flexible job shop scheduling. Moreover, the influence of the parameter setting is investigated by using Taguchi method of design-of-experiment (DOE), and suitable values are determined for key parameters. Finally, computational tests results with some benchmark instances and the comparisons to some existing algorithms are provided, which demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the nFOA in solving the SFTSP.},

	Abstract = {Social bees are known to avoid inflorescences marked with dead conspecifics or their smell. The avoidance response could be triggered by alarm signals actively given by attacked bees or by substances passively released through injuries as a by-product of the attack. To discriminate between these two options we note that both social and solitary bees are expected to react to nonsignalling cues associated with predation risk, while only social bees are expected to give alarm signals. We simulated risky inflorescences by pinching a landing bee with forceps, and compared the rate at which bees visited these experimental inflorescences and unmanipulated control inflorescences. We conducted the experiment with four species of social bees, Apis mellifera, Apis dorsata, Apis florea and Bombus terrestris and with three species of solitary bees, Eucera sp., Panurgus sp. and Nomia strigata. We found that while the three species of solitary bees responded similarly to control and experimental inflorescences, all four species of social bees strongly rejected inflorescences where we simulated a predation attempt. The finding that only social species avoided landing on dangerous inflorescences strongly suggests that the release of the alarm cue has been selected for its signalling value in social bees.},

Object: In this paper we propose an approach to allow SMEs to access SQA practices, using an SQA approach based on a continuous issue and error monitoring and a recommendation system that will suggest quality practices, recommending a set of quality actions based on the issues that previously created errors, so as to help SMEs to maintain quality above a minimum threshold. Method: First, we aim to identify a set of SQA practices applicable in SMEs, based on the main constraints of SMEs and a set of tools and practices to fulfill a complete DevOps pipeline. Second, we aim to define a recommendation system to provide software quality feedback to micro-teams, suggesting which action(s) they should take to maintain a certain quality level and allowing them to remove the most severe issues with the lowest possible effort. Our approach will be validated by a set of local SMEs. Moreover, the tools developed will be published as Open Source.},

In this paper, we summarized the characteristics of food from different perspectives and provided a survey of existing works. We categorized the functions of food into biological, psychological and cultural, and described how augmented and mixed reality technologies have been applied to various aspects of food. We then discussed about the structural research space based on the literatures to address the opportunities and challenges for further development around augmented food experience.

In order to isolate a sensitive- (length: 5 mm) and terminal-areas, an epoxy-resin adhesive was applied to the middle part of the narrow stick paper. AOD was immobilized to the sensitive area with photocrosslinkable polymer. The characteristics of the stick-type sniffer moistened with phosphate buffer were assessed using standard ethanol vapor supplied from a gas generator. The oxidation current of hydrogen peroxide, produced by the AOD enzymatic reaction by applying ethanol vapor, was detected a computer-controlled potentiostat at a fixed voltage of +900 mV. The calibration range of the ethanol sniffer covered the concentration range encountered in breath after alcohol consumption including the permissible legal limit (130 ppm) for driving, and the sensing range of smell in humans. As the physiological application, the bio-sniffer was used to monitor the concentration change of breath ethanol after drinking.},

It involves carefully examining the code, the design, and the documentation of software and checking these for aspects that are known to be potentially problematic based on past experience. Code smells are a metaphor to describe patterns that are generally associated with bad design and bad programming practices. Originally, code smells are used to find the places in software that could benefit from refactoring. In this paper we investigate how the quality of code can be automatically assessed by checking for the presence of code smells and how this approach can contribute to automatic code inspection. We present an approach for the automatic detection and visualization of code smells and discuss how this approach can be used in the design of a software inspection tool. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with the development of jCOSMO, a prototype code smell browser that detects and visualizes code smells in JAVA source code.

	Abstract = {Olfaction is a very important sense in daily life. Decline in olfaction has been reported to be an early symptom of diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It is therefore important to understand the condition of the olfactory system. However, existing olfactory measurement techniques suffer from the problems of scents scattering in the air and measurements needing a lot of time and effort. In this study, we developed an olfactory measurement system that uses pulse ejection. Unlike existing olfactory measurement techniques, our olfactory display employing pulse ejection measures olfaction by changing the ejection quantity. We conducted an experiment that measured and quantified the human olfactory characteristics in precise detail in response to pulsed scents. The results reveal that people are able to sense extremely small quantities of scent. Measurements were finished in approximately 5 min and were influenced very little by lingering scent. In the future we aim to find a diagnostic threshold for smell disorders through measurements of more people and hope that screening by olfactory measurement will be implemented at health checkups and in hospitals.},

However, it has been suggested that sequence variation in a nearby olfactory receptor (OR) cluster on chromosome 6p influences smell preference. To determine whether the HLA-linked OR genes contribute to previously observed HLA-mediated behaviors, we use the odor preference data from our earlier study in combination with a new resequencing study of four functional, HLA-linked OR genes in the same subjects. Our results indicate that OR alleles in the genes surveyed are not in linkage disequilibrium with HLA variation and do not explain the previous findings of HLA-associated odor preference.},

	Abstract = {Certain odours and certain tastes appear to share common perceptual properties. One example is sweetness, a perceptual experience that results from stimulation of taste receptors on the tongue typically by sugars. The experiment here examined for evidence of this perceptual similarity using a novel and indirect test. Participants were exposed six times each, to three odours (strawberry, caramel, and oregano) and three tastes (sucrose, saline, and citric acid). Following a 10-min interval, participants were given a surprise frequency estimation task, in which they had to judge how often each stimulus had occurred. If sweet-smelling strawberry and caramel odours really do share this perceptual characteristic in common with sweet tasting sucrose, then frequency estimates for sucrose should be overestimated relative to non-sweet tastes. Not only was this observed, but frequency estimates for sweet tastes were also found to correlate with (1) evaluations from a later test of similarity between these sweet smells and sucrose, and (2) the degree to which these odours smelled sweet. These findings suggest a shared perceptual feature between such odours and sucrose -- sweetness -- under conditions where no judgment of perceptual quality was required.},

	Abstract = {Floral scent has an important role in the reproductive processes of many plants and a considerable economic value in guaranteeing yield and quality of many crops. It also enhances the aesthetic properties of ornamental plants and cut flowers. Many floral scent volatiles fall into the terpenoid or phenylpropanoid/benzenoid classes of compounds. Although the biochemistry of floral scent is still a relatively new field of investigation, in the past decade investigators have begun to identify `scent genes'. Several of these genes, most of which, but not all, encode enzymes that directly catalyze the formation of volatile terpenoid or phenylpropanoid/benzenoid compounds, have now been used to manipulate, through genetic engineering techniques, the mix of volatiles emitted from the flowers of several plant species. The outcomes of these experiments, which are discussed here, have indicated that the genetic engineering approach to altering floral scents has potential; however, they have also revealed the limitations that result from our inadequate knowledge of the metabolic pathways responsible for scents and their regulation.},

	Abstract = {It has been advocated that Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is an effective technique to improve software maintainability through explicit support for modularising crosscutting concerns. However, in order to take the advantages of AOP, there is a need for supporting the systematic refactoring of crosscutting concerns to aspects. Existing techniques for aspect-oriented refactoring are too fine-grained and do not take the concern structure into consideration. This paper presents two categories towards a metaphor-based classification of crosscutting concerns driven by their manifested shapes through a system's modular structure. The proposed categories provide an intuitive and fundamental terminology for detecting concern-oriented design flaws and identifying refactorings in terms of recurring crosscutting structures. On top of this classification, we define a suite of metaphor-based refactorings to guide the ``aspectisation'' of each concern category. We evaluate our technique by classifying concerns of 23 design patterns and by proposing refactorings to aspectise them according to observations made in previous empirical studies. Based on our experience, we also determine a catalogue of potential additional categories and heuristics for refactoring of crosscutting concerns.},

	Abstract = {Various species of cyanobacteria may produce cyanotoxins, bad smell and taste and cause a deterioration of the water's sensory characteristics and serious harmful effects on human health. This study investigates the possibility of removing total algae and cyanobacteria from lake water by means of a hollow fiber microfiltration pilot plant (2--4m3/h). The influence of these treatments on water chemical and microbiological quality was evaluated too. Among the seventeen species of cyanobacteria analyzed, the highest density in the feed water was observed for Anabaena lemmermannii while the species most frequently detected was Microcystaceae D5. Microfiltration was able to achieve removal rates higher than 98% for a large number of species of cyanobacteria and the removal efficiency of total algae content was about 98--99%. Moreover, no release of toxins into the permeate water was observed during water treatment. Microfiltration was able to guarantee also good removal yields for turbidity (>90%), suspended solids (yield >80%) and organic compounds (yield of about 70% for UV absorbance at 254nm).},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a fault-prone prediction approach that combines a fault-prone prediction model and manual inspection. Manual inspection is conducted by a predefined checklist that consists of questions and scoring procedures. The questions capture the fault signs or indications that are difficult to be captured by source code metrics used as input by prediction models. Our approach consists of two steps. In the first, the modules are prioritized by a fault-prone prediction model. In the second step, an inspector inspects and scores α percent of the prioritized modules. We conducted a case study of source code modules in commercial software that had been maintained and evolved over ten years and compared AUC (Area Under the Curve) values of Alberg Diagram among three prediction models: (A) support vector machines, (B) lines of code, and (C) random predictor with four prioritization orders. Our results indicated that the maximum AUC values under appropriate α and the coefficient of the inspection score were larger than the AUC values of the prediction models without manual inspection in each of the four combinations and the three models in our context. In two combinations, our approach increased the AUC values to 0.860 from 0.774 and 0.724. Our results also indicated that one of the combinations monotonically increased the AUC values with the numbers of manually inspected modules. This might lead to flexible inspection; the number of manually inspected modules has not been preliminary determined, and the inspectors can inspect as many modules as possible, depending on the available effort.},

	Abstract = {Version control systems (VCS) have become indispensable software development tools. The version snapshots they store to provide support for change coordination and release management, effectively track the evolution of the versioned software and its development process. Despite this wealth of historical information, it has only been leveraged by tools that are dedicated to a specific task such as empirical validation of software engineering practices or fault prediction. General-purpose tool support for reasoning about the historical information stored in a version control system is limited. This paper provides a comprehensive description of a logic-based, general-purpose history query tool called Absinthe. Absinthe supports querying versioned Smalltalk system using logic queries in which quantified regular path expressions are embedded. These expressions lend themselves to specifying the properties that each individual version in a sequence of successive software versions ought to exhibit. To demonstrate the general-purpose nature of our history query tool, we use it to verify development process constraints, to identify temporal bad smells and to answer questions that developers commonly ask. Finally, we compare a query written in Absinthe to an equivalent one written in Smalltalk.},

	Abstract = {Software evolves continuously, it gets modified, enhanced, and new requirements always arise. If we do not spend time occasionally on improving our source code, its maintainability will inevitably decrease. The literature tells us that we can improve the maintainability of a software system by regularly refactoring it. But does refactoring really increase software maintainability? Can it happen that refactoring decreases the maintainability? Empirical studies show contradicting answers to these questions and there have been only a few studies which were performed in a large-scale, industrial context. In our paper, we assess these questions in an in vivo context, where we analyzed the source code and measured the maintainability of 6 large-scale, proprietary software systems in their manual refactoring phase. We analyzed 2.5 million lines of code and studied the effects on maintainability of 315 refactoring commits which fixed 1273 coding issues. We found that single refactorings only make a very little difference (sometimes even decrease maintainability), but a whole refactoring period, in general, can significantly increase maintainability, which can result not only in the local, but also in the global improvement of the code.},

	Abstract = {Context: Many metrics are used in software engineering research as surrogates for maintainability of software systems. Aim: Our aim was to investigate whether such metrics are consistent among themselves and the extent to which they predict maintenance effort at the entire system level. Method: The Maintainability Index, a set of structural measures, two code smells (Feature Envy and God Class) and size were applied to a set of four functionally equivalent systems. The metrics were compared with each other and with the outcome of a study in which six developers were hired to perform three maintenance tasks on the same systems. Results: The metrics were not mutually consistent. Only system size and low cohesion were strongly associated with increased maintenance effort. Conclusion: Apart from size, surrogate maintainability measures may not reflect future maintenance effort. Surrogates need to be evaluated in the contexts for which they will be used. While traditional metrics are used to identify problematic areas in the code, the improvements of the worst areas may, inadvertently, lead to more problems for the entire system. Our results suggest that local improvements should be accompanied by an evaluation at the system level.},

	Abstract = {In the general sphere of the teaching of software engineering concepts, it can be noted that there are very few pieces of work dealing with how to get across, through teaching, the practical experience that has been built up on the subject of object-oriented design. The few works that do exist focus on design patterns. Pattern catalogues, however, do not completely resolve the problem of imparting the experience about object-oriented design, an area where it is clear that the greatest benefit derived from the patterns is achieved when their designers are already-experienced. What is more, other elements associated with object-oriented knowledge, such as principles, heuristics, best practices, bad smells, etc., are components related to practical knowledge of design. These are barely taken into consideration, however. In an effort to solve these problems, we put forward an ontology which brings together and integrates object-oriented design which improves teaching, amongst other things. It makes the great quantity of knowledge that has been built up clearer and brings it together into a united whole. It is thus possible to create catalogues of integrated knowledge.},

	Abstract = {With billions of app downloads, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store succeeded to conquer mobile devices. However, this success also challenges app developers to publish high-quality apps to keep attracting and satisfying end-users. In particular, taming the ever-growing complexity of mobile apps to cope with maintenance and evolution tasks under such a pressure may lead to bad development choices. While these bad choices, a.k.a. code smells, are widely studied in object-oriented software, their study in the context of mobile apps, and in particular iOS apps, remains in its infancy. Therefore, in this paper, we consider the presence of object-oriented and iOS-specific code smells by analyzing 279 open-source iOS apps. As part of this empirical study, we extended the Paprika toolkit, which was previously designed to analyze Android apps, in order to support the analysis of iOS apps developed in Objective-C or Swift. We report on the results of this analysis as well as a comparison between iOS and Android apps. We comment our findings related to the quality of apps in these two ecosystems. Interestingly, we observed that iOS apps tend to contain the same proportions of code smells regardless of the development language, but they seem to be less prone to code smells compared to Android apps.},

	Abstract = {Code smells indicate poor implementation choices that may hinder program comprehension and maintenance. Their informal definition allows developers to follow different heuristics to detect smells in their projects. Machine learning has been used to customize smell detection according to the developer's perception. However, such customization is not guided (i.e. constrained) to consider alternative heuristics used by developers when detecting smells. As a result, their customization might not be efficient, requiring a considerable effort to reach high effectiveness. In fact, there is no empirical knowledge yet about the efficiency of such unguided approaches for supporting developer-sensitive smell detection. This paper presents Histrategy, a guided customization technique to improve the efficiency on smell detection. Histrategy considers a limited set of detection strategies, produced from different detection heuristics, as input of a customization process. The output of the customization process consists of a detection strategy tailored to each developer. The technique was evaluated in an experimental study with 48 developers and four types of code smells. The results showed that Histrategy is able to outperform six widely adopted machine learning algorithms - used in unguided approaches - both in effectiveness and efficiency. It was also confirmed that most developers benefit from using alternative heuristics to: (i) build their tailored detection strategies, and (ii) achieve efficient smell detection.},

	Abstract = {A current and difficult challenge in the software engineering arena is assessment of code smells and subsequent re-engineering decisions. The mechanics of seventy-two individual, object-oriented refactorings are specified in the seminal text by Fowler, providing the steps that need to be undertaken to complete each. While it is relatively easy to identify dasiarelatedpsila refactorings, i.e., those that each refactoring itself directly uses as part of those mechanics, what is not so clear is the chain of required refactorings that may emerge due to these indirect (and composite) relationships. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of fourteen of the seventy-two refactorings, identifying, for each, its related refactorings and the implications this may have for the overall time and effort required to carry out each. We supported our analysis with data from a previous empirical analysis. The key result was that refactorings inducing long chains tended to be utilized less by developers than refactorings with short chains, suggesting that complexity given by long chains may be a real consideration prior to refactoring; empirically, long chains were found to be composed of sets of smaller, inter-related refactorings. On a general note, understanding the composition of refactorings is recognized as an emerging yet under-researched area but has significant implications for the amount of effort that a developer might have to invest in any single dasiachangepsila to a system involving refactoring.},

Using the Ad-Smell, the customer can smell the advertising movie. The users need an Ad-Smell application to read a smell and an olfactory display in order to release scents.
There are two main parts in an Ad-Smell system, which are an olfactory display and a release smell application. An olfactory display consists of a control box and four smell boxes with four fans. Fans will be turned on and release scents when receiving the signal from an Ad-Smell application. The Ad-Smell application is designed to detect a customer movement from a web camera and then show an advertising movie. During a display of advertising movie, Ad-Smell reads control signals in the movie and decides to send signals to an olfactory display. The Ad-Smell application consists of six major components: 1) Webcam Controlling, 2) Motion Detection, 3) Movie Controlling, 4) SubSmell Reading, 5) Scent Releasing, and 6) Olfactory Display Monitoring. We use Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 to develop the user interface and the Ad-Smell components.},

These conditions analyze internal structure inside a method with data flow analysis. Our research improves these RFC based on more refined data flow analysis and presents its formal description.

	Abstract = {Android code smells are bad implementation practices within Android applications (or apps) that may lead to poor software quality. These code smells are known to degrade the performance of apps and to have an impact on energy consumption. However, few studies have assessed the positive impact on energy consumption when correcting code smells. In this paper, we therefore propose a tooled and reproducible approach, called HOT-PEPPER, to automatically correct code smells and evaluate their impact on energy consumption. Currently, HOT-PEPPER is able to automatically correct three types of Android-specific code smells: Internal Getter/Setter, Member Ignoring Method, and HashMap Usage. HOT-PEPPER derives four versions of the apps by correcting each detected smell independently, and all of them at once. HOT-PEPPER is able to report on the energy consumption of each app version with a single user scenario test. Our empirical study on five open-source Android apps shows that correcting the three aforementioned Android code smells effectively and significantly reduces the energy consumption of apps. In particular, we observed a global reduction in energy consumption by 4,83% in one app when the three code smells are corrected. We also take advantage of the flexibility of HOT-PEPPER to investigate the impact of three picture smells (bad picture format, compression, and bitmap format) in sample apps. We observed that the usage of optimised JPG pictures with the Android default bitmap format is the most energy efficient combination in Android apps. We believe that developers can benefit from our approach and results to guide their refactoring, and thus improve the energy consumption of their mobile apps.},

	Abstract = {JavaScript is a powerful and flexible prototype-based scripting language that is increasingly used by developers to create interactive web applications. The language is interpreted, dynamic, weakly-typed, and has first-class functions. In addition, it interacts with other web languages such as CSS and HTML at runtime. All these characteristics make JavaScript code particularly error-prone and challenging to write and maintain. Code smells are patterns in the source code that can adversely influence program comprehension and maintainability of the program in the long term. We propose a set of 13 JavaScript code smells, collected from various developer resources. We present a JavaScript code smell detection technique called JSNOSE. Our metric-based approach combines static and dynamic analysis to detect smells in client-side code. This automated technique can help developers to spot code that could benefit from refactoring. We evaluate the smell finding capabilities of our technique through an empirical study. By analyzing 11 web applications, we investigate which smells detected by JSNOSE are more prevalent.},

Considering the types of secure transactions being conducted, businesses are rigorously testing their sites for security flaws. In spite of this testing, some design flaws still remain that prevent secure usage. In this paper, we examine the prevalence of user-visible security design flaws by looking at sites from 214 U.S. financial institutions. We specifically chose financial websites because of their high security requirements. We found a number of flaws that may lead users to make bad security decisions, even if they are knowledgeable about security and exhibit proper browser use consistent with the site's security policies. To our surprise, these design flaws were widespread. We found that 76% of the sites in our survey suffered from at least one design flaw. This indicates that these flaws are not widely understood, even by experts who are responsible for web security. Finally, we present our methodology for testing websites and discuss how it can help systematically discover user-visible security design flaws.},

Current developments in mobile robots and the dynamic nature of environments that the robot performs its tasks have increased robot's computation requirements. Behaviour based robot has been lauded to be robust and cost effective to counter the earlier mentioned problems. Experiments leading to the implementation of our behaviour based robot in this paper were done on our integrated testbed built specifically for mobile olfaction related experiments. The functionality and advantages of using the testbed were highlighted. Furthermore, various mapping techniques were implemented for both single and multiple robot system which has the potential to aid odour source localisation task carried by the robot. Finally, a simple behaviour based approach was implemented on a robot with sense of smell and sight in dynamic conditions to evade the time-consuming and rigidity of algorithm based approach. The enhancements of this approach on the different odour source localisation task were highlighted. A Braitenberg vehicle was implemented for odour source localisation.},

@article{BOUCHARD2017120,
	Abstract = {The chemosensory abilities (i.e. taste, smell and trigeminal perception) of odontocete cetaceans are still widely unknown. However, a better understanding of their potential use of these senses would not only improve our knowledge of their behavioural ecology, but also allow us to develop behavioural enrichment strategies for captive odontocetes using sensory stimulation. While studies on taste bud anatomy and taste receptor genes in these animals have provided useful information, ultimately behavioural experiments are crucial to assess whether odontocetes use their sense of taste in water. Go/no go and conditioning experiments in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have previously shown that they can perceive basic tastes, but it is still unclear whether they are able to detect food-related chemical mixtures. We thus designed a spontaneous choice experiment using floating taste diffusers in order to test whether captive bottlenose dolphins could detect and display attraction behaviours towards a natural fish taste stimulus. Four dolphins, two adult males and two juvenile females, were involved in the experiment. Our results show that the juvenile females interacted with the fish taste diffuser significantly more than with the control. However, the adult males did not seem to make a clear choice. Also, the juvenile females showed a significantly greater level of motivation towards the test, spending more time interacting with the diffusers and holding them in their open mouth more often than the adult males. These findings corroborate previous behavioural studies suggesting that taste perception is functional in bottlenose dolphins, at least in young individuals. They also suggest that the taste of their natural prey could be attractive to them. Finally, the methodology used in this study proved to be easy to implement in captive odontocetes and will allow for investigating further their use of taste in feeding and social contexts without the need for conditioning experiments that require long periods of training. This experimental design could also be included in behavioural enrichment initiatives in captive marine mammals.},

	Abstract = {The evolution rate of mobile applications is much higher than regular software applications having shorter release deadlines and smaller code base. Mobile applications tend to be evolved quickly by developers to meet several new customer requirements and fix discovered bugs. However, evolving the existing features and design may introduce bad design practices, also called code smells, which can highly decrease the maintainability and performance of these mobile applications. However, unlike the area of object-oriented software systems, the detection of code smells in mobile applications received a very little of attention. Recent, few studies defined a set of quality metrics for Android applications and proposed a support to manually write a set of rules to detect code smells by combining these quality metrics. However, finding the best combination of metrics and their thresholds to identify code smells is left to the developer as a manual process. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rules for the detection of code smells in Android applications using a multi-objective genetic programming algorithm (MOGP). The MOGP algorithm aims at finding the best set of rules that cover a set of code smell examples of Android applications based on two conflicting objective functions of precision and recall. We evaluate our approach on 184 Android projects with source code hosted in GitHub. The statistical test of our results show that the generated detection rules identified 10 Android smell types on these mobile applications with an average correctness higher than 82% and an average relevance of 77% based on the feedback of active developers of mobile apps.},

Background
The character or timing of chronic cough is considered to be unpredictable for diagnosing its cause. However, the associations of cough triggers with cough pathophysiology remains unknown.
Methods
We developed a closed questionnaire listing 18 triggers that were reported by ≥1% of 213 patients in a retrospective survey. Using this questionnaire, patients with cough-predominant or cough-variant asthma (n = 140) and those with non-asthmatic cough (54) were asked whether their cough was induced by the listed triggers. Associations of triggers with causes of cough, airway sensitivity to inhaled methacholine, exhaled nitric oxide (NO) levels, number of sensitizing allergens, and scores from gastroesophageal reflux (GER) questionnaires were examined. Factor analysis was used to categorize variables, including the 12 most common cough triggers, diagnosis of asthmatic cough, airway sensitivity, and exhaled NO levels.
Results
Cold air and fatigue/stress induced cough more often in asthmatic coughers than in non-asthmatic coughers. Spices and meals induced cough more frequently in GER-coughers (n = 19). Patients who marked cold air as the trigger were more sensitive to inhaled methacholine and showed higher exhaled NO levels than those who did not mark this trigger. The post-nasal drip trigger was associated with elevated exhaled NO levels, and this association was mainly exhibited by patients with cough-predominant asthma. The triggers pollen and mold smell were associated with a number of sensitizing allergens. The number of triggers was weakly associated with GER scores. By factor analysis, cold air, fatigue/stress, asthmatic cough, airway hypersensitivity, and elevated NO levels were categorized into the same factor. Conclusions
Several cough triggers may reflect the pathophysiology of prolonged or chronic cough.},

There are two mechanisms that aid in kin discrimination: phenotype matching and familiarity. Dogs may be a good model for assessing these mechanisms as dogs are a promiscuous social species with a keen sense of smell. Domestic dogs of both sexes were presented with two scents (close kin, distant-kin) and preference was assessed through three measures (latency to approach, number of visits, time spent). Experiment 1 explored the possibility of phenotype matching as subjects had no contact with sires, whose scent was presented alongside a control male's scent. Experiment 2 explored recognition of siblings raised with the subjects and then separated at seven weeks of age. Whereas female dogs in this experiment did not show a statistically significant preference, male dogs showed a preference for distant-kin when presented with sire and female sibling samples.},

As the STCE research area has matured and the number of related studies has increased, it is important to systematically categorize the current state-of-the-art and to provide an overview of the trends in this field. Such summarized and categorized results provide many benefits to the broader community. For example, they are valuable resources for new researchers (e.g., PhD students) aiming to conduct additional secondary studies.
Method
In this work, we systematically classify the body of knowledge related to STCE through a systematic mapping (SM) study. As part of this study, we pose a set of research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria, and systematically develop and refine a systematic map.
Results
Our study pool includes a set of 60 studies published in the area of STCE between 1999 and 2012. Our mapping data is available through an online publicly-accessible repository. We derive the trends for various aspects of STCE. Among our results are the following: (1) There is an acceptable mix of papers with respect to different contribution facets in the field of STCE and the top two leading facets are tool (68%) and method (65%). The studies that presented new processes, however, had a low rate (3%), which denotes the need for more process-related studies in this area. (2) Results of investigation about research facet of studies and comparing our result to other SM studies shows that, similar to other fields in software engineering, STCE is moving towards more rigorous validation approaches. (3) A good mixture of STCE activities has been presented in the primary studies. Among them, the two leading activities are quality assessment and co-maintenance of test-code with production code. The highest growth rate for co-maintenance activities in recent years shows the importance and challenges involved in this activity. (4) There are two main categories of quality assessment activity: detection of test smells and oracle assertion adequacy. (5) JUnit is the leading test framework which has been used in about 50% of the studies. (6) There is a good mixture of SUT types used in the studies: academic experimental systems (or simple code examples), real open-source and commercial systems. (7) Among 41 tools that are proposed for STCE, less than half of the tools (45%) were available for download. It is good to have this percentile of tools to be available, although not perfect, since the availability of tools can lead to higher impact on research community and industry.
Conclusion
We discuss the emerging trends in STCE, and discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners in this area. The results of our systematic mapping can help researchers to obtain an overview of existing STCE approaches and spot areas in the field that require more attention from the research community.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of food odorant names on feelings through the verbal measurement of emotions. Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, 88 participants were asked to report their feelings about 17 food odorants, randomly presented in six sensory booth sessions and in three conditions. In two conditions, an actual odorant was presented blind or in association with its name. In a third condition, only the odorant name was presented. Feeling measurements were conducted by using the ScentMoveTM questionnaire (Porcherot et al., 2010). Participants also rated the familiarity, acceptability, and typicality of the odorants. Results indicated that the odorant name information may influence the reported feelings, as already observed by several authors for traditional liking assessments, with differences among feeling dimensions and odorants. The odorants could be gathered into four groups, with either matches between expected feelings from the odorant name and experienced feelings from the smell evaluation for eight odorants (e.g., caramel, citrus, and mint), or discrepancies between expected and experience feelings for nine odorants, and with no effect of the odorant name information (e.g., strawberry, vanilla), few, or high positive effects of the odorant name information (e.g., cola, chicken). Typicality scores did not differ between the different groups, showing that higher odorant typicality would not systematically result in a match between expectation and experience, or in a positive effect of the name information. It was therefore investigated in a second experiment if the group constitution could be explained by the odorant recognition scores that were measured from a free recognition task for the 17 odorants presented in the blind condition. The results of the two experiments are discussed in relation to dissimilarities between smell and food experiences and to lack of context.},

	Abstract = {It is widely believed that human languages cannot encode odors. While this is true for English, and other related languages, data from some non-Western languages challenge this view. Maniq, a language spoken by a small population of nomadic hunter--gatherers in southern Thailand, is such a language. It has a lexicon of over a dozen terms dedicated to smell. We examined the semantics of these smell terms in 3 experiments (exemplar listing, similarity judgment and off-line rating). The exemplar listing task confirmed that Maniq smell terms have complex meanings encoding smell qualities. Analyses of the similarity data revealed that the odor lexicon is coherently structured by two dimensions. The underlying dimensions are pleasantness and dangerousness, as verified by the off-line rating study. Ethnographic data illustrate that smell terms have detailed semantics tapping into broader cultural constructs. Contrary to the widespread view that languages cannot encode odors, the Maniq data show odor can be a coherent semantic domain, thus shedding new light on the limits of language.},

	Abstract = {Trials on the transmission of olfactory information together with audio/visual information are currently being conducted in the field of multimedia. However, continuous emission of odor creates problems of human adaptation to the lingering olfactory stimuli. To overcome such a problem we developed an olfactory display. This display has high emission control so that it can provide stable pulse emission of scents. We previously proposed two scent presentation methods synchronized with the userpsilas breathing pattern.The first method presents smell using a breath sensor. The second method presents smell using the ejection interval Deltat,determined by the olfactory characteristics. The results of evaluation experiments and a questionnaire survey of users revealed the proposed methods provide a continuous sense of smell to the user, avoiding adaptation.},

In fact, during program understanding the names given to code entities represent one of the major sources of information used by developers. We conjecture that lexicon bad smells, such as, extreme contractions, inconsistent term use, odd grammatical structure, etc., can hinder the execution of maintenance tasks which rely on program understanding. We propose an approach to determine the extent of this impact and instantiate it on the task of concept location. In particular, we conducted a study on two open source software systems where we investigated how lexicon bad smells affect Information Retrieval-based concept location. In this study, the classes changed in response to past modification requests are located before and after lexicon bad smells are identified and removed from the source code. The results indicate that lexicon bad smells impact concept location when using IR-based techniques.},

Determinations of certain elements in distilled spirits are required to assess their quality and safety and can be used to judge their nutritional value or to verify if finished products conform to specific safety regulations. This review is dedicated to spectrochemical techniques and sample-preparation procedures used in elemental analysis of distilled spirits and covers studies published in the past 20 years. We pay particular attention to sample-treatment procedures and calibration strategies prior to measurements by different atomic spectrometry methods. We also discuss possible sources of elements in distilled spirits and the suitability of the information about elemental contents for identifying and classifying distilled spirits.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a pseudo-gustatory display based on the cross-modal interactions that underlie the perception of flavor. Although several studies on visual, auditory, haptic, and olfactory displays have been conducted, gustatory displays have seldom been studied. This scarcity has been attributed to the fact that synthesizing arbitrary taste from basic tastants is difficult. On the other hand, it has been noted that the perception of taste is influenced by visual cues, auditory cues, smell, the trigeminal system, and touch. In our research, we aim at utilizing this influence between modalities for realizing a "pseudo-gustatory" system that enables the user to experience various tastes without changing the chemical composition of foods. Based on this concept, we built a "Meta Cookie" system to change the perceived taste of a cookie by overlaying visual and olfactory information onto a real cookie which an AR marker pattern. We performed an experiment that investigates how people experience the flavor of a plain cookie by using our system. The result suggests that our system can change the perceived taste based on the effect of the cross-modal interaction of vision, olfaction and gustation.},

	Abstract = {Three experiments were conducted to investigate if sexual experience affects the behavioural response of male rats to natural oestrus odours and constituent odorants. In the first experiment, 16 male Brown Norway rats were exposed before and after sexual training to four odours (1-hexanol (herb odour), a ketone mixture, and faeces from mares and rats in oestrus) presented one at a time to individual rats during a 30-min test. More penile erections were observed during tests when rats were exposed to the two types of faeces as well as the ketone mixture compared to 1-hexanol, both when sexually na{\"\i}ve (P=0.032) and experienced (P=0.002). In the second experiment, 30 male rats were tested using a habituation/dishabituation protocol. The rats were able to distinguish the ketone mixture used in Experiment 1 from another single-molecule ketone (P<0.001), which has previously been found to elicit erections in male rats. Finally in the third experiment, five faeces samples each from male, oestrus and di-oestrus rats and horses (N=30) were analysed using gas chromatography--mass spectrometry (GC--MS) for the presence of three ketones and 1-hexanol using menthol as an added calibrating compound. Although significant intra-species differences in ketone composition were found between faeces from males and females in oestrus and di-oestrus, these differences were dissimilar across species. Also, 1-hexanol was present in all six faeces types. The results indicate that the ketones used may not be specific oestrus odorants, but may share volatile characteristics with natural oestrus odours. These findings are discussed in relation to oestrus odours and their potential commonality across mammalian species.},

@article{ZERLOTTIN2013129,
	Abstract = {We experimentally studied the occurrence of spontaneous self-heating of sludge after drying, to understand its nature, course and remediation. The sludge originates from primary and biological treatment of both municipal and industrial wastewater, the latter largely dominant (approx. 90% total organic carbon, mainly from local tanneries). Dried sludge is collected into big--bags (approx. 1.5m3) and landfilled in a dedicated site. After several years of regular operation of the landfill, without any management or environmental issue, indications of local warming emerged, together with smoke and smelling emissions, and local subsidence. During a two year monitoring activity, temperatures locally as high as 80$\,^{\circ}$C have been detected, 6--10m deep. Experiments were carried out on large quantities of dried sludge (∼1t), monitoring the temperature of the samples over long periods of time (months), aiming to reproduce the spontaneous self-heating, under different conditions, to spot enhancing and damping factors. Results demonstrate that air is a key factor to trigger and modulate the self-heating. Water, in addition to air, supports and emphasizes the heating. Unusual drying operation was found to affect dramatically the self-heating activity, up to spontaneous combustion, while ordinary drying conditions yield a sludge with a moderate self-heating inclination. Temperature values as well as heating time scales suggest that the exothermic process nature is mainly chemical and physical, while microbiological activity might be a co-factor.},

While large companies are able to spare resources for studying and improving usability in their products, smaller businesses often divert theirs in other aspects. To help these cases, researches have devised automatic approaches for user interaction analysis, and there are commercial services that offer automated usability statistics at relatively low fees. However, most existing approaches still fall short in specifying the usability problems concretely enough to identify and suggest solutions. In this work we describe usability smells of user interaction, i.e., hints of usability problems on running web applications, and the process in which they can be identified by analyzing user interaction events. We also describe USF, the tool that implements the process in a fully automated way with minimum setup effort. USF analyses user interaction events on-the-fly, discovers usability smells and reports them together with a concrete solution in terms of a usability refactoring, providing usability advice for deployed web applications.},

	Abstract = {We introduce inScent, a wearable olfactory display that can be worn in mobile everyday situations and allows the user to receive personal scented notifications, i.e. scentifications. Olfaction, i.e. the sense of smell, is used by humans as a sensorial information channel as an element for experiencing the environment. Olfactory sensations are closely linked to emotions and memories, but also notify about personal dangers such as fire or foulness. We want to utilize the properties of smell as a notification channel by amplifying received mobile notifications with artificially emitted scents. We built a wearable olfactory display that can be worn as a pendant around the neck and contains up to eight different scent aromas that can be inserted and quickly exchanged via small scent cartridges. Upon emission, scent aroma is vaporized and blown towards the user. A hardware - and software framework is presented that allows developers to add scents to their mobile applications. In a qualitative user study, participants wore the inScent wearable in public. We used subsequent semi-structured interviews and grounded theory to build a common understanding of the experience and derived lessons learned for the use of scentifications in mobile situations.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present an empirical study on the refactoring activity in three well-known projects. We have studied five research questions that explore the different types of refactorings applied to different types of sources, the individual contribution of team members on refactoring activities, the alignment of refactoring activity with release dates and testing periods, and the motivation behind the applied refactorings. The studied projects have a history of 12, 7, and 6 years, respectively. We have found that there is very little variation in the types of refactorings applied on test code, since the majority of the refactorings focus on the reorganization and renaming of classes. Additionally, we have identified that the refactoring decision making and application is often performed by individual refactoring "managers". We have found a strong alignment between refactoring activity and release dates. Moreover, we found that the development teams apply a considerable amount of refactorings during testing periods. Finally, we have also found that in addition to code smell resolution the main drivers for applying refactorings are the introduction of extension points, and the resolution of backward compatibility issues.},

	Abstract = {Iron and copper salts have complex olfactory and gustatory properties including a metallic flavor component that is decreased by nasal occlusion. To examine the sensory properties of ferrous sulfate and copper sulfate, a trained descriptive panel evaluated these compounds at equal molarity and perceived equal intensity with and without nasal occlusion. Ferrous sulfate exhibited a metallic taste and metallic aftertaste and copper sulfate exhibited a more pronounced metallic aftertaste. Metallic sensations were decreased by nasal occlusion, which in the absence of any orthonasal metallic smell, implies that the sensations were retronasally perceived volatiles in the nose open condition. Ferrous sulfate showed a larger effect of nasal occlusion. A second experiment isolated ferrous sulfate solutions from oral contact via a plastic barrier. In comparison to a condition in which oral contact was allowed, intensity ratings were decreased. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that rinses with solutions of metal salts, particularly ferrous sulfate, generate volatile lipid oxidation products in the mouth that are perceived retronasally as metallic flavors.},

Summary
The male genitalia cosmetic surgery matches an ever growing need. The aim of this study is to describe our penile lengthening and widening procedures, the benefits and complications that could result from it.
Patients and methods
We perform these procedures since 1992 and treated close to 2000 patients. Thanks to our expertise and after succeeding in standardizing our techniques, we achieved a retrospective survey on 103 patients operated between 2004 and 2006. We describe here the two processes of our operating technique and we analyse the results obtained 1 month, 3 months and 1 year after the surgery.
Results
In most cases, combining a penis adipose tissue grafting, a suspensory ligament section and an adequate skin plasty is proven to be necessary in order to obtain both lengthening and widening increases. One year later, the increase is about 2.7cm in length, corresponding to 28%, and 2.6cm in circumference, corresponding to 27%. The complications (cutaneous necrosis, haematoma, lymphoedema, disharmonies), whenever they may exist, are most of the time spontaneously resolutive.
Conclusion
Combining a penile fat tissue grafting with a suspensory ligament section allows us to answer to most of patients' expectations. However, several liposculpturing sessions might be necessary in order to get satisfactory results.},

	Abstract = {Pulegone is a chemical derived from plants of the mint family (Mentha spp.) that irritates the trigeminal nerve of mammals when inhaled and causes gastric distress when consumed. We examined whether free-ranging mammalian predators would stop depredating untreated eggs in gulls' nests that smelled of pulegone. Prior to the nesting period, we distributed pulegone-injected eggs around a gull colony so that local mammalian predators could learn that opening such eggs was painful. We then selected 165 ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) and 165 California gull (Larus californicus) nests in the colony and randomly assigned them to one of the three treatments: (1) nests treated by placing two drops of pulegone (each 1ml) on the ground on opposite sides of the nest, (2) nests treated by spraying 2ml of pulegone around the nest's periphery, or (3) nests left untreated as a control. For both gull species, there were no differences among treatments in proportion of nests that were depredated. In a second experiment, which was also preceded by an exposure period when pulegone-injected eggs were distributed, 400 ring-billed and 150 California gull nests located in three colonies were selected to receive one of the two treatments. Half were treated by placing 2ml of pulegone in a cup and burying it beneath the nest and half were left untreated as a control. Although 30--40% of the control and treated nests were depredated, differences between treated and control nests were not detected. Application of pulegone to nests did not decrease viability of those eggs that escaped depredation. Nevertheless, these results failed to support the hypothesis that egg survival of colonial birds could be increased by training free-ranging predators not to open untreated eggs in pulegone-scented nests.},

	Abstract = {Human have five senses which are visual, auditory, smell, touch and taste. The sense of touch is occurring when the skin contact with any object and human can percept the shape, temperature, vibration of the object. As well known, the spatial density of receptors located in the human skin differed of different parts such as index finger. Therefore, the sensitivity of each finger were differed from each other. In the present study, we developed a novel automatic vibrotactile patterns delivery device that is capable of perform the tactile cognitive experiment. It can serve to determining the sensitivity of each finger that contributes to tactile spatial discrimination. The primary device consists of eight piezo-electric units, slider, hand support and a controller. The device is controlled by a computer. To evaluate the performance of the device, we conducted a basic function test. The results indicated that the device can record reliable data and control the tactile pattern position precisely. Finally, ten young subjects consented to participate in the position discrimination tasks. The subjects were asked to detect the tactile stimuli and report the location. We found that index finger has higher accuracy of vibrotactile discrimination than the other fingers. Moreover, the sensitivity of distal phalanx part is higher than middle phalanx.},

	Abstract = {To determine whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) affects stress responses in rats, we investigated its influence on several behavioral tests. Female rats were fed a diet deficient in (n-3) fatty acid from mating through pregnancy and lactation. Male pups fed the same diet as their dams were used for experiments. The effects of dietary (n-3) fatty acid deficiency and supplementation with DHA on psychological stress and conditioned-fear stress were investigated. The effect of DHA on psychological stress was examined by an elevated plus-maze test. The (n-3) deficient rats spent significantly (P<0.05) less time in the open arms; after 1 week of supplementation with DHA, they showed a significant (P<0.01) improvement. We then examined the paired effects of DHA and CRH on stress manifestations by an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) cannulation and behavior testing. An i.c.v. infusion of CRH (500 pmol) under resting conditions was shown to have stress-inducing effects on behavior such as decreases of rearing, smelling and feeding, and increases of face washing; the supplementation of DHA significantly improved these distress behaviors. Finally, conditioned fear was induced by 40 min forced exposure to a cage in which the rat had experienced footshocks (30×1 mA×1 s) 1 day before. Freezing behavior was dramatically suppressed by the supplementation of DHA, even 48 h after the conditioning treatment. Furthermore, the effect of DHA on the conditioned fear stress response is maintained over a long-term period. The i.c.v. pre-treatment of rats with bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, enhanced the conditioned-fear-induced freezing time in a dose-dependent fashion in the (n-3) fatty acid deficient animals. Significantly, the DHA supplemented group was not affected by the pre-treatment with bicuculline. From these findings, it is concluded that the involvement of DHA in stress responses may act via a GABAA receptor-mediated mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Brucella spp. lumazine synthase (BLS) is a highly immunogenic decameric protein. It has been previously evaluated as a carrier to increase the immunogenicity of peptides fused to its N-termini. VP8 is a sialic acid binding domain of rotavirus external capsid protein VP4, which is involved in virus adhesion to host cells. In this work, the C486 bovine rotavirus (BRV) VP8 core protein (VP8d) was fused to the structure of BLS with the aim to produce an enhancement of the immune response against BRV VP8 and to evaluate the possible use of this antigen for vaccine development. The feasibility of using BLS as an antigen delivery system of polypeptides larger in size than those previously tested was also evaluated. Groups of female mice were immunized with BLS-VP8d fusion protein, VP8d or an equimolar mixture of purified VP8d and BLS (BLS+VP8d). Dams immunized with BLS-VP8 induced 97.5--100% protection against homologous challenge with C486 BRV; while pups born to dams immunized either with VP8d or BLS+VP8d presented a significant lower level of protection. The neutralizing antibody pattern was also significantly different among these experimental groups, and in concordance with challenge experiment. Overall, these results demonstrate that the BLS-VP8d chimeric protein is properly folded and stable, and that the BLS scaffold is a potent antigen delivery system that enhances the antibody response against BRV and elicits complete homotypic passive protection in a suckling mouse model.},

@article{CHRISTENSEN2008136,
	Abstract = {Horses frequently react nervously when passing animal production farms and other places with distinctive smells, leading riders to believe that horses are innately frightened by certain odours. In three experiments, we investigated how horses respond to (1) urine from wolves and lions, (2) blood from slaughtered conspecifics and fur-derived wolf odour, and (3) a sudden auditory stimulus in either presence or absence of fur-derived wolf odour. The experiments were carried out under standardised conditions using a total of 45 na{\"\i}ve, 2-year-old horses. In the first two experiments we found that horses showed significant changes in behaviour (Experiments 1 and 2: increased sniffing; Experiment 2 only: increased vigilance, decreased eating, and more behavioural shifts), but no increase in heart rate compared to controls when exposed to predator odours and conspecific blood in a known test environment. However, the third experiment showed that exposure to a combination of wolf odour and a sudden stimulus (sound of a moving plastic bag) caused significantly increased heart rate responses and a tendency to a longer latency to resume feeding, compared to control horses exposed to the sudden stimulus without the wolf odour. The results indicate that predator odour per se does not frighten horses but it may cause an increased level of vigilance. The presence of predator odour may, however, cause an increased heart rate response if horses are presented to an additional fear-eliciting stimulus. This strategy may be adaptive in the wild where equids share habitats with their predators, and have to trade-off time and energy spent on anti-predation responses against time allocated to essential non-defensive activities.},

	Abstract = {Context: Several studies suggest that there is a relation between code smells and architecture degradation. They claim that classes, which have degraded architecture-wise, can be detected on the basis of code smells, at least if these are manually identified in the source code.
Objective: To evaluate the suitability of contemporary code smell detection tools by combining different smell categories for finding classes that show symptoms of architecture degradation.
Method: A case study is performed in which architectural inconsistencies in an open source system are detected via reflexion modeling and code smell metrics are collected through several tools. Using data mining techniques, we investigate if it is possible to automatically and accurately classify classes connected to architectural inconsistencies based on the gathered code smell data.
Results: Results suggest that existing code smell detection techniques, as implemented in contemporary tools, are not sufficiently accurate for classifying whether a class contains architectural inconsistencies, even when combining categories of code smells.
Conclusion: It seems that current automated code smell detection techniques require fine-tuning for a specific system if they are to be used for finding classes with architectural inconsistencies. More research on architecture violation causes is needed to build more accurate detection techniques that work out-of-the-box.},

However, the sensation of flavor is rarely considered in the age of digital communication mainly due to the unavailability of flavors as a digitally controllable media. This paper introduces a digital instrument (Digital Flavor Synthesizing device), which actuates taste (electrical and thermal stimulation) and smell sensations (controlled scent emitting) together to simulate different flavors digitally. A preliminary user experiment is conducted to study the effectiveness of this method with predefined five different flavor stimuli. Experimental results show that the users were effectively able to identify different flavors such as minty, spicy, and lemony. Moreover, we outline several challenges ahead along with future possibilities of this technology. In summary, our work demonstrates a novel controllable instrument for flavor simulation, which will be valuable in multimodal interactive systems for rendering virtual flavors digitally.},

In experiments performed when the fawns were between ten and 27 days old, it was found that all fawns showed preferences for sucrose but aversions towards tannic acid and ascorbic acid. However, differences in selectivity towards tannic acid were present already before the fawns became functional ruminants and these individual differences lasted 5 years. Moreover, individuals that ingested overall less tannic acid, searched more thoroughly between food sources. When the foraging behaviour was compared with age (11--41 days old and 65--97 days old), it was found that the time a fawn spent eating, increased with age, and the time spent on exploration, smelling and tasting plants decreased with age. Furthermore, the fawns increased their intake of grass and herbs, while the intake of soil and dead plant material decreased with age.},

	Abstract = {Although the recruitment of larvae and juveniles of marine fishes into estuaries has been well documented, little is known about the factors governing the immigration of estuary-associated marine fishes into estuaries. Fishes have a well-developed sense of smell and it has been suggested by several workers that olfactory cues of freshwater or estuarine origin serve as stimuli, attracting larvae and juveniles of estuary-associated species into estuaries. Attraction of postflexion Rhabdosargus holubi larvae to estuary and river water from the Kowie estuarine system, South Africa, was measured using a rectangular choice chamber. In experiments, conducted during peak recruitment periods, larvae selected estuary and river water with a significantly higher frequency than sea water. This study, the first to assess the possible role of olfaction in the recruitment process of an estuary-associated marine fish species, demonstrates that larvae are able to recognise water from different origins, probably based on odour.},

	Abstract = {In this study we have analysed the chemical composition of the extractable components from the elastomeric shells from n=27 explanted implants (n=16 patients), n=2 new PIP implants, and from explanted Eurosilicone and McGhan implants (n=2 for each brand). Empty elastomeric PIP shells (n=2) were also available for analysis. Prostheses were explanted between 2011 and 2012, after 3--11 years of implantation. Patients presented pre- and post-operation complications of different degrees. First we evaluated the micro-structural features of the shells by phase contrast microscopy, and compared the results with those obtained using attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR), head space gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HS-GC--MS) and GC--MS in direct injection mode. The results of these studies confirm and explain the conclusion of previous international investigations that evidenced a linear decrease of rupture rate for prostheses implanted after 2006. The analytical identification of a series of UV sensitive radical photo-initiators (0.1%--0.2% w/w), belonging to the benzophenone family, in the shells of new and explanted prostheses produced after 2006 (associated with a strong smell absent in those produced earlier), in parallel to (ii) the removal of the anti bleed barrier from their manufacturing procedure (introduced after 2001), strongly suggested that from 2007, the PIP company used a polymerisation process different from that declared, probably as a consequence of the first reports of rupture problems. In addition, the HS-GC--MS experiments demonstrated that at body temperature the diffusivity of low molecular weight (LMW) silicones present in the PIP filler silicone is significantly higher than that of LMW silicones in an approved implant.},

	Abstract = {Visual perspective has dominated experience research in human-technology interaction for decades now. The neglect of other sensory modalities is gradually being addressed by scholars and designers, who investigate user experience based on touch, smell, taste, sound and even expressive bodily interactions. In cognitive and affective processes, user experience is always multi-modal, not just regarding perceived multi-sensory information, but also while perceiving through one modality we mentally construct information relevant to the other senses. This article reports the results of an experiment, where participants (N = 52) appraised materials either only by touching them or only by seeing. The results indicate that with certain affects, the logic of the appraisal depends on the modality. These results are discussed within the theoretical framework of mental content, apperception, and appraisal. Further, we discuss the relevance of the findings for material design, especially in the context of multimodal interaction.},

	Abstract = {Fire is one of the most common hazards in US households. In 2006 alone, 2705 people were killed due to fire in building structures. 74% of the deaths result from fires in homes with no smoke alarms or no working smoke alarms while surveys report that 96% of all homes have at least one smoke alarm. This study discusses the development of a fire sensing system that is not only capable of detecting fire in its early stage but also of classifying the fire based on the smell of the smoke in the environment. By using an array of sensors along with a neural network for sensor pattern recognition, an impressive result is obtained. Instead of confining the ANN to a PC based application, this work extends the implementation of the neural network fire classifier in a general purpose microcontroller. The result is a low cost intelligent embedded fire classifier that can be used in real life situations for fire hazards minimization, for example this intelligent fire classifier can be used for the development of a smart extinguisher that detects the fire, classifies it and then uses appropriate extinguishing material required for extinguishing the particular class of fire.},

	Abstract = {In software engineering, maintainability is related to investigating the defects and their causes, correcting the defects and modifying the system to meet customer requirements. Maintenance is a time consuming activity within the software life cycle. Therefore, there is a need for efficiently organizing the software resources in terms of time, cost and personnel for maintenance activity. One way of efficiently managing maintenance resources is to predict defects that may occur after the deployment. Many researchers so far have built defect prediction models using different sets of metrics such as churn and static code metrics. However, hidden causes of defects such as code smells have not been investigated thoroughly. In this study we propose using data science and analytics techniques on software data to build defect prediction models. In order to build the prediction model we used code smells metrics, churn metrics and combination of churn and code smells metrics. The results of our experiments on two different software companies show that code smells is a good indicator of defect proneness of the software product. Therefore, we recommend that code smells metrics should be used to train a defect prediction model to guide the software maintenance team.},

	Abstract = {Objectives
Tobacco smoke exposure (TSE) is associated with many adverse health outcomes. The goal of this study was to provide insight into the prevalence and location of self-reported TSE outside the home for US adults and children.
Study design
Cross-sectional survey.
Methods
Data from a nationally representative sample of US adults from 2014 were included. Participants who responded that they smelled smoke during the past seven days in various settings were considered to have been exposed to TSE. Parents were asked about TSE exposure of their children.
Results
Sixty-nine percent of all adults reported TSE outside their home in the past seven days. The most common exposure location among adults was on a public sidewalk and outside the doorway of a building (both 33%). Thirty-three percent of parents reported outside the home TSE for their children in the past seven days. Most commonly, the reported exposure was `In some other place(s)' (16%), followed by at a relative's house (10%).
Conclusions
This study reports on TSE outside the home in a wide variety of settings and a broad range of ages in a nationally representative US sample. A high proportion of US adults and children are exposed to TSE outside the home in indoor, outdoor, public, and private settings. Smoke-free laws, clinical interventions, education, and a change in social norms are required to stop TSE.},

From 2011--2015, we utilized mixed methods including: document analysis, social network analysis, interviews, focus groups, and surveys to study one correctional facility through the process of design, construction, and operations. We found that adhering to the principles of integrative design resulted in the design of a high performance building that reduced energy consumption, improved building function, increased staff productivity, increased safety and occupant well-being for both staff and offenders. We also found that the design flaws in the building were the direct result of excluding a key building occupant group, offenders.

For instance, people have been shown to consistently match specific tastes and flavours to particular visual shapes. That said, further research is still needed in order to clarify how and why such correspondences exist. Here, we report a series of four experiments designed to assess what drives people's matching of visual roundness/angularity to both `basic' taste names and actual tastants. In Experiment 1, crossmodal correspondences between taste names and abstract shapes were assessed. Next, the results were replicated in a larger online study (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 assessed the role of liking in the association between taste words and morphed shapes along the roundness/angularity dimension. In Experiment 4, basic tastants were mapped to the roundness/angularity dimension, while the mediating role of liking for each taste was assessed. Across the 4 experiments, participants consistently matched sweetness to roundness. What is more, people's liking for a taste (but not their liking for imagined tastes) appeared to influence their shape matching responses. These results are discussed in terms of crossmodal correspondences, and a potential role for hedonics is outlined.},

	Abstract = {Background: Inheritance is one of the main features in the object-oriented paradigm (OOP). Nonetheless, previous work recommend carefully using it, suggesting alternatives such as the adoption of composition with implementation of interfaces. Despite of being a well-studied theme, there is still little knowledge if such recommendations have been widely adopted by developers in general. Aims: This work aims at evaluating how the inheritance and composition with interfaces have been used in Java, comparing new projects with older ones (transversal), and also the different releases of the same projects (longitudinal). Method: A total of 1, 656 open-source projects built between 1997 and 2013, hosted in the repositories GitHub and SourceForge, were analyzed. The likelihood of more recent projects using inheritance and interfaces differently from older ones was analyzed considering indicators, such as, the prevalence of corrective changes, instanceof operations, and code smells. Regression analysis, chi-squared test of proportions and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. In addition, a thematic analysis based method was used to verify how often and why inheritance and interface are added or removed from classes. Results: We observed that developers still use inheritance primarily for code reuse, motivated by the need to avoid duplicity of source code. In newer projects, classes in inheritance had fewer corrective changes and subclasses had fewer use of the instance of operator. However, as they evolve, classes in inheritance tend to become complex as changes occur. Classes implementing interfaces have shown little relation to the interfaces, and there is indication that interfaces are still underutilized. Conclusion: These results show there is still some lack of knowledge about the use of recommended object-oriented practices, suggesting the need of training developers on how to design better classes.},

	Abstract = {In contrast to physiology and morphology, our understanding of how behaviors evolve is limited. This is a challenging task, as it involves the identification of both the underlying genetic basis and the resultant physiological changes that lead to behavioral divergence. In this review, we focus on chemosensory systems, mostly in Drosophila, as they are one of the best-characterized components of the nervous system in model organisms, and evolve rapidly between species. We examine the hypothesis that changes at the level of chemosensory systems contribute to the diversification of behaviors. In particular, we review recent progress in understanding how genetic changes between species affect chemosensory systems and translate into divergent behaviors. A major evolutionary trend is the rapid diversification of the chemoreceptor repertoire among species. We focus mostly on functional comparative studies involving model species, highlighting examples where changes in chemoreceptor identity and expression are sufficient to provoke changes in neural circuit activity and thus behavior. We conclude that while we are beginning to understand the role that the peripheral nervous system (PNS) plays in behavioral evolution, how the central nervous system (CNS) evolves to produce behavioral changes is largely unknown, and we advocate the need to expand functional comparative studies to address these questions.},

	Abstract = {When monitoring landscape changes, the visual landscape should also be considered. This pertains to the information function of ecosystems and landscapes that refers to environmental structure and its function for satisfying needs. These needs of human perception include a certain equipment of landscape with stimuli, spatial orientation, as well as aesthetical-emotional needs. However, previous approaches of environmental monitoring and registration of landscape changes exclusively focus on the ecosystem; aesthetic and structural characteristics are evaluated, if at all, only via easily quantifiable variables in a data oriented manner that illustrates the diversity of individual landscape elements without theoretically grounding them based on general hypotheses and a theoretical concept. Based on results from perception research and information theory, therefore, a method for registering the visual landscape on different complexity levels is developed. This includes:-``elements'' (i.e. ``element level''), that is the description of the different types of land use and structure elements within a landscape unit. Furthermore, under these elements a variety of manifestations are also subsumed, such as small spatial dimensional relations, as well as individual synesthetic perceptions (noise and smells);-``characteristics'' (i.e. ``shape level''), that is the typical combinations of elements, design shapes and proportions;-and the overall area perception, that is the ``character'' (i.e. the space level) of a landscape as the result of a characterization process that classifies, illustrates and describes areas that are similar in appearance. One possible application of this approach can be demonstrated by the impacts of streets on the visual landscape. This example makes it evident that indicators for landscape diversity are only able to illustrate changes of individual elements but not of the character of landscapes themselves. This fact makes it necessary to additionally integrate aspects aside from quantitative ones when evaluating the visual landscape. Furthermore, it is necessary to empirically verify aspects that are significant for the perception of landscapes in order to make them more accessible than has been thus far for evaluations in the sense of indicators.},

Despite a growing number of olfactory HCI prototypes, there have been only a few attempts to study the sense of smell as an interaction modality. Here, we focus on the exploration of olfaction for in-car interaction design by establishing a mapping between three different driving-related messages ("Slow down", "Fill gas", "Passing by a point of interest") and four scents (lemon, lavender, peppermint, rose). The results of our first study demonstrate strong associations between, for instance, the "Slow down" message and the scent of lemon, the "Fill gas" message and the scent of peppermint, the "Passing by a point of interest" message and the scent of rose. These findings have been confirmed in our second study, where participants expressed their mapping preferences while performing a simulated driving task.},

	Abstract = {End-user programmers such as scientists and engineers often adopt a visual domain-specific language due to its easy learnability, but then they later encounter problems when trying to create high-performance programs. In response, they typically have had to resort to learning and using general textual languages such as C or Fortran as a supplement or replacement for the visual language. This paper proposes a technique, called Smell-driven performance analysis, for helping end-user programmers to overcome performance problems without leaving the visual dataflow paradigm. The technique involves statically analyzing programs to heuristically detect areas with potential performance problems (``bad smells''), alerting enduser programmers about problems, and advising on how to fix those problems. We have implemented a prototype for applying this technique and conducted a user study in which end-user programmers diagnosed performance problems. The experiment showed our technique increased participants' success rates at finding problems and decreased the time required for finding solutions. Qualitatively, 92% of participants said our technique was helpful, and they listed numerous specific benefits provided.},

	Abstract = {One of the important activities in re-engineering process is detecting design flaws. Such design flaws prevent an efficient maintenance, and further development of a system. This research proposes a novel metric-based heuristic framework to detect and locate object-oriented design flaws from the source code. It is accomplished by evaluating design quality of an object-oriented system through quantifying deviations from good design heuristics and principles. While design flaws can occur at any level, the proposed approach assesses the design quality of internal and external structure of a system at the class level which is the most fundamental level of a system. In a nutshell, design flaws are detected and located systematically in two phases using a generic OO design knowledge-base. In the first phase, hotspots are detected by primitive classifiers via measuring metrics indicating a design feature (e.g. complexity). In the second phase, individual design flaws are detected by composite classifiers using a proper set of metrics. We have chosen JBoss application server as the case study, due to its pure OO large size structure, and its success as an open source J2EE platform among developers},

	Abstract = {Visual cues are likely to convey early sensory impressions and to generate strong expectations about product characteristics, which in turn could influence the final assessment of a product. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of color on the verbal measurement of emotions in response to different perfumes in fabric softeners, the hypothesis being that color-perfume congruent pairs will induce enhanced positive emotional responses. In a first experiment, 102 participants were asked to report their feelings for nine perfumed fabric softeners, which were perfumed with one of three perfume variants and presented as one of three color variants. Verbal measurements of emotions were performed by using the ScentMove{\texttrademark} questionnaire. Results indicated that the subjective affective responses varied as a function of perfumes and were influenced by colors. A second experiment was conducted to verify whether the color-perfume congruency could be optimized. A group of 70 respondents participated in a color-matching exercise with the same three perfume variants and 10 possible colors, including the three original color variants. Results confirmed that other color-perfume associations could be more than or equally congruent to those presented in the first experiment. A third experiment was carried out to investigate whether increasing the color-perfume congruency would result in a significant increase of the subjective affective response. A group of 95 respondents were asked to report their feelings for nine perfumed fabric softeners, which were perfumed with the same three perfume variants and presented as one of three optimal color variants. The optimization of color-perfume pairing did not result in a significant increase of the subjective affective response. More generally, this study underlines the predominant role of perfume in the emotional response and a more limited influence of color.},

	Abstract = {The concepts of quantum brain, quantum mind and quantum consciousness have been increasingly gaining currency in recent years, both in scientific papers and in the popular press. In fact, the concept of the quantum brain is a general framework. Included in it are basically four main sub-headings. These are often incorrectly used interchangeably. The first of these and the one which started the quantum mind/consciousness debate was the place of consciousness in the problem of measurement in quantum mechanics. Debate on the problem of quantum measurement and about the place of the conscious observer has lasted almost a century. One solution to this problem is that the participation of a conscious observer in the experiment will radically change our understanding of the universe and our relationship with the outside world. The second topic is that of quantum biology. This topic has become a popular field of research, especially in the last decade. It concerns whether or not the rules of quantum physics operate in biological structures. It has been shown in the latest research on photosynthesis, the sense of smell and magnetic direction finding in animals that the laws of quantum physics may operate in warm-wet-noisy biological structures. The third sub-heading is quantum neurobiology. This topic has not yet gained wide acceptance and is still in its early stages. Its primary purpose is directed to understand whether the laws of quantum physics are effective in the biology of the nervous system or not. A further step in brain neurobiology, toward the understanding of consciousness formation, is the research of quantum laws effects upon neural network functions. The fourth and final topic is quantum psychopathology. This topic takes its basis and its support from quantum neurobiology. It comes from the idea that if quantum physics is involved in the normal working of the brain, diseased conditions of the brain such as depression, anxiety, dementia, schizophrenia and hallucinations can be explained by quantum physical pathology. In this article, these topics will be reviewed in a general framework, and for the first time a general classification will be made for the quantum brain theory.},

Currently Fowler's definitions are too informal to implement in a pattern-searching tool. In this paper we use an expert panel to evaluate our enhanced definitions for five of Fowler's bad smells. We use a questionnaire to survey four experts' opinions of our bad smell definitions. Our results show that the experts basically agree with our enhanced definitions of the message chains, middle man and speculative generality bad smells. However, there are strong disagreements on our definitions of the data clumps and switch statements bad smells. We present enhanced definitions on the basis of these expert opinions.},

A randomly selected sample of 1778 people answered a web-based questionnaire. The majority of respondents claimed to consume clams (pullet carpet shell clam and Japanese carpet shell clam) and usually prefer bivalves from national production. Smell, size and cleaned shells were considered as the most important criteria when choosing live bivalves. Most consumers buy clams in supermarkets and revealed good knowledge about the risks associated with its consumption. Trust in the selling establishment and product's label information was the main perceived quality criteria associated to bivalve purchasing. Nonetheless, consumers' attitudes and preferences differed considerably according to their demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The current findings provide a useful tool for producers and stakeholders involved in the trade chain of bivalves to understand the consumption profile and the most important quality criteria involved in bivalve purchase. Additionally, it is an important tool to predict the risks of bivalve consumption as well as to understand the different scenarios of contamination occurring in harvesting areas by national competent authorities.},

	Abstract = {A well-known bad code smell in refactoring and software maintenance is duplicated code, or code clones. A code clone is a code fragment that is identical or similar to another. Unjustified code clones increase code size, make maintenance and comprehension more difficult, and also indicate design problems such as lack of encapsulation or abstraction.
This paper proposes a token and AST based hybrid approach to automatically detecting code clones in Erlang/OTP programs, underlying a collection of refactorings to support user-controlled automatic clone removal, and examines their application in substantial case studies. Both the clone detector and the refactorings are integrated within Wrangler, the refactoring tool developed at Kent for Erlang/OTP.},

	Abstract = {Background Allergy is associated with considerable morbidity. Objective The aim of this multicenter study was to provide insight into allergy knowledge and perceptions among the population. Methods During the World Allergy Day, several allergy clinics conducted public meetings to encourage the awareness of and education in allergy. At the beginning, participants filled out a questionnaire to assess their knowledge about what is allergy and to determine by whom those symptoms are cared. Results A total of 256 participants (187 women/69 men, mean age, 31.2 $\pm$ 12.5 years) completed the survey. Of the 202 participants with symptoms, 58.9% had physician-diagnosed allergic disease. Among the 19 symptoms evaluated, 56.5% of the symptoms were recognized as related with allergy, and this increased in compliance with education level (r = +0.427; P < 0.001) but not with diagnosed allergy (P = 0.34). Sneezing was the most common symptom thought to be related with allergy-related symptom (77.5%), whereas loss of smell was the least one (37.9%). Participants were more likely to be cared by an allergologist (72.9%) followed by other specialties, when experiencing allergy. Conclusions Increasing the awareness for allergic symptoms is the key not only for the diagnosis but also for the optimal treatment. Therefore, education is an important component of prevention and control of allergic diseases.},

These are just a few of the problems to deal with. We present OSpace - an approach for designing, building, and exploring an olfactory interaction space. Our paper is the first to explore in detail not only the scent-delivery parameters but also the air extraction issues. We conducted a user study to demonstrate how the scent detection/lingering times can be acquired under different air extraction conditions, and how the impact of scent type, dilution, and intensity can be investigated. Results show that with our setup, the scents can be perceived by the user within ten seconds and it takes less than nine seconds for the scents to disappear, both when the extraction is on and off. We discuss the practical application of these results for HCI.

	Abstract = {Eating motivation is induced not only by negative energy balance but also food related cues. However, neural processing for acquisition of learned food preference remains to be established. This study aimed to identify hippocampal neural signaling in response to olfactory cue (chocolate scent) after completion of repetitive chocolate sessions. Male Swiss albino mice implanted with intracranial electrode into the hippocampus were used for local field potential (LFP) recording. Animals were given chocolate sessions (a piece of 2g chocolate per each mouse to eat on day 1, 3, 5 and 7). Hippocampal CA1 LFP signals and exploratory behavior of animals receiving chocolate scent were analyzed before and after chocolate sessions. The experiment was performed in a place preference-like apparatus with the zones of normal food pellet and chocolate (both kept in a small perforated cup for smell dispersion) at the opposite ends. Following chocolate sessions, time spent in a chocolate zone and CA1 LFP patterns were analyzed in comparison to control levels. Two-way ANOVA revealed significant increase in time spent seeking for chocolate. Frequency analysis of LFP power spectra revealed significant increases in delta and theta powers. Phase-amplitude analysis showed significant increase in maximal modulation index and decrease in frequency for phase of theta-high gamma coupling. Taken together, neural signaling in the hippocampus was sensitive to chocolate olfactory cue that might underlie learning process in response to repeated chocolate consumptions that primed intense food approaching behavior. Ultimately, these LFP patterns might reflect motivation to eat and predict feeding probability.},

Reduction of energy usage is required due to rapid increases in electricity consumption due to the scorching summer heat in recent years. The common ways to provide information on energy consumption mainly occur through "visualization" of information. On the contrary, olfactory stimulation can be performed while working, and it is effective also when the degree of arousal is low. This study considers applications on the basis of the concept of "smellization" of information using olfactive stimulation.

As a consequence, we observe the phenomenon referred to as "software entropy" or "software decay": the software design continually degrades making maintenance and functional extensions overly costly if not impossible. There exist a number of approaches to identify design flaws (problem detection) and to remedy them (refactoring). There is, however, a conceptual gap between these two stages: There is no appropriate support for the automated mapping of design flaws to possible solutions. Here we propose an integrated, quality-driven and tool-supported methodology to support object-oriented software evolution. Our approach is based on the novel concept of "correction strategies". Correction strategies serve as reference descriptions that enable a human-assisted tool to plan and perform all necessary steps for the safe removal of detected design flaws, with special concern towards the targeted quality goals of the restructuring process. We briefly sketch our tool chain and illustrate our approach with the help of a medium-sized real-world case-study.},

GNU Autotools are widely used in the open source community, but users face various challenges from its hard to comprehend nature and staging of multiple code generation steps, often leading to low quality and error-prone build code. In this paper, we present a platform, AutoHaven, to provide a foundation for developers to create analysis tools to help them understand, maintain, and migrate their GNU Autotools build systems. Internally it uses approximate parsing and symbolic analysis of the build logic. We illustrate the use of the platform with two tools: ACSense helps developers to better understand their build systems and ACSniff detects build smells to improve build code quality. Our evaluation shows that AutoHaven can support most GNU Autotools build systems and can detect build smells in the wild.},

	Abstract = {We tried to deter free-ranging, mammalian predators from opening untreated eggs by first teaching them during a training period that such behavior will cause discomfort. The discomfort was inflicted by injecting eggs with pulegone, a volatile chemical which irritates the trigeminal nerve upon inhalation and produces gastric distress upon digestion. Pulegone-injected eggs were distributed in eight study sites and were followed by an experiment where untreated eggs were placed in either untreated nests or ones sprayed with pulegone. Our objective was to deceive predators into thinking that the eggs in the latter nests contained pulegone. Some nests were clumped together to simulate the nests of a colonial nesting species, and others were dispersed and hidden to simulate the nests of solitary nesters. Among colonial nests, eggs in nests treated with pulegone survived an average of 4 days compared to 3 days for those in untreated nests. Among solitary nests, there were no differences in the survival of treated and control nests. These findings suggest that egg predation in nesting colonies can be reduced or delayed by training local predators to avoid pulegone-injected eggs and then making the nests in the colony smell of pulegone.},

	Abstract = {Unanticipated changes to complex software systems can introduce anomalies such as duplicated code, suboptimal inheritance relationships and a proliferation of run-time downcasts. Refactoring to eliminate these anomalies may not be an option, at least in certain stages of software evolution. Classboxes are modules that restrict the visibility of changes to selected clients only, thereby offering more freedom in the way unanticipated changes may be implemented, and thus reducing the need for convoluted design anomalies. In this paper we demonstrate how classboxes can be implemented in statically-typed languages like Java. We also present an extended case study of Swing, a Java GUI package built on top of AWT, and we document the ensuing anomalies that Swing introduces. We show how Classbox/J, a prototype implementation of classboxes for Java, is used to provide a cleaner implementation of Swing using local refinement rather than subclassing.},

	Abstract = {Premature neonates frequently need to spend several weeks or months in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). These neonates will experience a significant amount of pain, stress and discomfort during their hospital stay due to various medical interventions they will receive ranging from feeding to surgery. Although pharmacological pain treatments are available, often they are not suited for relieving of day-to-day discomfort and pain. Evidence is accumulating in the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions to relieve pain and discomfort for premature neonates, for example: kangaroo care, facilitated tucking, and aromatherapy. This paper describes a new non-pharmacological comforting solution that combines various non-pharmacological interventions in a holistic way to provide comfort to neonates. The proposed solution, Hugsy, facilitates kangaroo care moments, and simulates the kangaroo care experience within the incubator by providing the neonate with a parent's unique smell, heartbeat, and feeling of support. We discuss the design and application of the solution, as well as the clinical study conducted with the first prototypes. Results indicate the Hugsy is a promising solution for comforting premature neonates and enhancing parent-child bonding.},

The empirical part of the study is based on the self-reflective anthropologic inquiry method. This study sets out to propose that the awkwardness and setback experienced by the client, customer or visitor, may generate his/her agency to establish a more clear-cut construction of the experiential framework. However, if attempted the disambiguation demands significant emotional and, sometimes, physical labour, typically not undertaken willingly, and potentially resulting in the subject's avoidance of exposure to similar experiences in future. Introducing the notion of `situational liminality', the paper re-focuses the critical edge of inquiry away from agency-reducing aspects of experience economy, towards reflecting on their enforced, albeit not deliberate, agency-inducing consequences. By exploring the `liquid' underpinnings of situational liminality, this study contributes to the ongoing discussion on liquid modernity in organizational context.},

	Abstract = {Many human olfactory experiments call for fast and stable stimulus-rise times as well as exact and stable stimulus-onset times. Due to these temporal demands, an olfactometer is often needed. However, an olfactometer is a piece of equipment that either comes with a high price tag or requires a high degree of technical expertise to build and/or to run. Here, we detail the construction of an olfactometer that is constructed almost exclusively with ``off-the-shelf'' parts, requires little technical knowledge to build, has relatively low price tags, and is controlled by E-Prime, a turnkey-ready and easily-programmable software commonly used in psychological experiments. The olfactometer can present either solid or liquid odor sources, and it exhibits a fast stimulus-rise time and a fast and stable stimulus-onset time. We provide a detailed description of the olfactometer construction, a list of its individual parts and prices, as well as potential modifications to the design. In addition, we present odor onset and concentration curves as measured with a photo-ionization detector, together with corresponding GC/MS analyses of signal-intensity drop (5.9%) over a longer period of use. Finally, we present data from behavioral and psychophysiological recordings demonstrating that the olfactometer is suitable for use during event-related EEG experiments.},

	Abstract = {Our recent research has shown that, in large-scale software systems, defective files seldom exist alone. They are usually architecturally connected, and their architectural structures exhibit significant design flaws which propagate bugginess among files. We call these flawed structures the architecture roots, a type of technical debt that incurs high maintenance penalties. Removing the architecture roots of bugginess requires refactoring, but the benefits of refactoring have historically been difficult for architects to quantify or justify. In this paper, we present a case study of identifying and quantifying such architecture debts in a large-scale industrial software project. Our approach is to model and analyze software architecture as a set of design rule spaces (DRSpaces). Using data extracted from the project's development artifacts, we were able to identify the files implicated in architecture flaws and suggest refactorings based on removing these flaws. Then we built economic models of the before and (predicted) after states, which gave the organization confidence that doing the refactorings made business sense, in terms of a handsome return on investment.},

	Abstract = {Authentication mechanisms are considered the typical method to secure financial websites. Context authentication has become increasingly important in the arena of online banking, which involves sensitive data that belong to users who trust their banks. Multifactor authentication is the most commonly used method of strengthening the log-in process in e-banking. Developing a usable and secure authentication approach and method is the most challenging area for researchers in the fields of security and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This paper describes a work-in-progress towards a new approach for authenticating users when access online banking by giving them the opportunity to choose their preferred method to log into e-banking. In our complex experiment with 100 online banking customers, we simulate an original online banking platform based on the proposed approach; then, we evaluate the usability and security of three different methods and assess user awareness of the most visible security design flaws. The initial result shows that the new system model was able to assess the usability and security of different multifactor authentication methods and it is considered a first attempt towards a usable and secure authentication approach.},

An experiment was performed to compare these modalities as secondary display mechanisms used to deliver notifications to users working on a cognitively engaging primary task. It was verified that the disruptiveness and effectiveness of notifications varied with the notification modality. The olfactory modality was shown to be less effective in delivering notifications than the other modalities, but produced a less disruptive effect on user engagement in the primary task.

	Abstract = {A custom-made atmospheric argon micro-plasma system was employed to dissociate dimethyl sulfide (DMS) into a non-foul-smelling species. The proposed system takes the advantages of low energy requirement and non-thermal process with a constant flow rate at ambient condition. In the experiments, the compositions of DMS/argon plasma, the residual gaseous phases, and solid precipitates were respectively characterized using an optical emission spectrometer, various gas-phase analyzers, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. For 400ppm DMS introduced into argon plasma with two pairs of electrodes (90W), a complete decomposition of DMS was achieved; the DMS became converted into excited species such as C*, C2*, H*, and CH*. When gaseous products were taken away from the treatment area, the excited species tended to recombine and form stable compounds or species, which formed as solid particles and gaseous phases. The solid deposition was likely formed by the agglomeration of C-, H-, and S-containing species that became deposited on the quartz inner tube. For the residual gaseous phases, low-molecular-weight segments mostly recombined into relatively thermodynamic stable species, such as hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon disulfide. The dissociation mechanism and treatment efficiency are discussed, and a treatment of converting DMS into H2-, CS2-, and H2S-dominant by-products is proposed.},

	Abstract = {Repeated exposure to a mixture of two odors can increase their perceived similarity to each other when presented separately. Experiment 1 failed to detect any reduction of this effect by an interference treatment consisting of separate exposures to the odors after they had first been presented as a mixture. Exposure to a mixture also results in participants mistakenly rating this mixture and its elements as having occurred with equal frequency (i.e., confusing the mixture and its elements). The interference treatment did not affect this either, whereas it did change judgments about the frequency of a color--odor mixture and its elements. The greater resistance to interference of odor--odor learning compared to color--odor learning may result from configural encoding of odor--odor mixtures. Experiment 2 found that separate exposures to two odors not previously mixed decreased their perceived similarity. This result was inconsistent with the possibility that the interference treatment in Experiment 1 had tended to increase the similarity of the two odors, for example, by a process of sensory adaptation. Rather it suggested a process akin to acquired distinctiveness.},

	Abstract = {Although the sense of smell is involved in numerous survival functions, the processing of body odor emitted by dangerous individuals is far from understood. The aim of the study was to explore how human fight chemosignals communicating aggression can alter brain activation related to an attentional bias and danger detection. While the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was seen involved in processing threat-related emotional information, danger detection and error evaluation, it still remains unknown whether human chemosignals communicating aggression can potentially modulate this activation. In the fMRI experiment, healthy male and female normosmic odor recipients (n=18) completed a higher-order processing task (emotional Stroop task with the word categories anger, anxiety, happiness and neutral) while exposed to aggression and exercise chemosignals (collected from a different group of healthy male donors; n=16). Our results provide first evidence that aggression chemosignals induce a time-sensitive attentional bias in chemosensory danger detection and modulate limbic system activation. During exposure to aggression chemosignals compared to exercise chemosignals, functional imaging data indicates an enhancement of thalamus, hypothalamus and insula activation (p<.05, FWE-corrected). Together with the thalamus, the ACC was seen activated in response to threat-related words (p<.001). Chemosensory priming and habituation to body odor signals are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Recent and past studies have shown that poor source code lexicon negatively affects software understand ability, maintainability, and, overall, quality. Besides a poor usage of lexicon and documentation, sometimes a software artifact description is misleading with respect to its implementation. Consequently, developers will spend more time and effort when understanding these software artifacts, or even make wrong assumptions when they use them. This paper introduces the definition of software linguistic antipatterns, and defines a family of them, i.e., those related to inconsistencies (i) between method signatures, documentation, and behavior and (ii) between attribute names, types, and comments. Whereas "design" antipatterns represent recurring, poor design choices, linguistic antipatterns represent recurring, poor naming and commenting choices. The paper provides a first catalogue of one family of linguistic antipatterns, showing real examples of such antipatterns and explaining what kind of misunderstanding they can cause. Also, the paper proposes a detector prototype for Java programs called LAPD (Linguistic Anti-Pattern Detector), and reports a study investigating the presence of linguistic antipatterns in four Java software projects.},

	Abstract = {Chinese medical formula (CMF) is the main therapies in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical practices. Discovery of the CMF empirical knowledge of the famous TCM physicians in clincal data is significant. This paper proposes an effective data mining approach to analyze and uncover the clinical CMF empirical knowledge of famous TCM physicians. Complex network is a current hot research topic in complex systems field. We construct the combination network of CMFs by graph method and have a statistical analysis of the network based on large-size CMF data set. As we known, CMF has a number of constituent herbs, which are prescribed by TCM physicians. We consider any CMF with same element herb has correlation to each other. That is, we construct a connected sub-graph with the CMF as node and the edge weight is computed by an appropriate similarity method. With CMF dataset, we can build CMF network with dense connected edges. We implement an algorithm based on the 'hub' node features of the CMF relation network to extract the core CMFs in a large size CMFs. Thereafter, the maximum frequent itemset algorithm is applied to discover the core herbal combinations from the core CMFs. We have utilized the network-based method to discover several core CMFs from the outpatient data of the famous TCM physicians. The clinical CMFs for disharmony between the liver and spleen syndrome are analyzed. The preliminary results show that we propose an effective approach for core herbal combination knowledge discovery in large size CMF data sets.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has shown that gas sensors can be used to classify odors when used in highly controlled experimental testing chambers. However, potential ubicomp applications require these sensors to perform an analysis in less controlled environments, particularly at a distance. In this paper, we discuss our design of uSmell---a gas sensor system for sensing smell in ubicomp environments---and an evaluation of its basic efficacy, effects of airflow and distance on classification accuracy, and in an example application. Our system samples an odor fingerprint from eight metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors every second. It then processes the time series data to extract three features that highlight how time and distance affect the eight MOS gas sensors' ability to react to the gas molecules released by an odor every 5 s; this generates 24 features in total that are then used to train a decision tree classifier. Using this approach, our system can classify a set of odors with 88 % accuracy when placed both in a small container with the samples and in open air 0.5--2 m from the odor samples. We also demonstrate its ability to classify odors in less controlled environments that might be targets for ubicomp applications by deploying it in a bathroom for a week. These results show the potential for applying this sensing toward the development of context-aware systems, such as lifelogging applications or those geared toward enhancing the sustainability of natural resources (e.g., an automatic dual-flush toilet that always uses an appropriate amount of water based on the user's toileting activities).},

	Abstract = {Bad requirements quality can cause expensive consequences during the software development lifecycle, especially if iterations are long and feedback comes late. We aim at a light-weight static requirements analysis approach that allows for rapid checks immediately when requirements are written down. We transfer the concept of code smells to requirements engineering as Requirements Smells. To evaluate the benefits and limitations, we define Requirements Smells, realize our concepts for a smell detection in a prototype called Smella and apply Smella in a series of cases provided by three industrial and a university context. The automatic detection yields an average precision of 59% at an average recall of 82% with high variation. The evaluation in practical environments indicates benefits such as an increase of the awareness of quality defects. Yet, some smells were not clearly distinguishable. Lightweight smell detection can uncover many practically relevant requirements defects in a reasonably precise way. Although some smells need to be defined more clearly, smell detection provides a helpful means to support quality assurance in requirements engineering, for instance, as a supplement to reviews.},

	Abstract = {Whereas odour--colour correspondences seem to be evident in everyday life, little research has attempted to investigate associations between colours and odours over the last decade. Nonetheless, some previous studies have demonstrated the existence of robust associations between specific odours (mainly fragrances) and colours (see Dematt{\`e} et al., 2006, Gilbert et al., 1996, Schifferstein and Tanudjaja, 2004). Here, we extended these findings to mainly food and drink related odours. Furthermore, testing was conducted with similar odours, which allowed us to better understand the nuances of the association. In the experiment, 155 untrained French subjects were first presented with 16 food and flower natural odorants and asked to select from among 24 colours the one that best matched each given olfactory stimulus. Secondly, they rated each odour according to five descriptors (association difficulty, intensity, familiarity, pleasantness and edibility). Participants matched olfactory stimuli with colours in a non-random manner. Indeed, significant colour characterizations were found for all odours. Significant differences in colour choice were also reported between very similar odours. These results confirm the existence of consistent odour--colour associations; and explore more precisely their subtleties. This underlines the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these crossmodal correspondences.},

	Abstract = {The wide-spread adoption of the agile movement has rapidly changed the landscape of software industry. In particular, Scrum is an agile process framework that has become extremely popular in industry. However, the practical implementation of Scrum in companies rarely follows the text book ideals, as companies often deviate from the proposed Scrum practices for various reasons. While some deviations may be well motivated and reasonable, companies can also be tempted to adjust Scrum for the company without clearly understanding the consequences of the deviations. In this paper our aim is to identify ways of potentially harmful mishandling of Scrum in industry based on empirical data collected in semi-structured interviews involving 18 teams in 11 companies. The (mal)practices that were identified at least in three different teams are presented in a semi-formal manner as anti-patterns. The study resulted in 14 anti-patterns that express the context of the deviation, the deviation itself, the broken core principles of Scrum, and the possible consequences of the deviation. In addition, where available, we have included company recommendations regarding the deviations. Furthermore, we identify potential risk areas in Scrum based on an analysis of the relationships between anti-patterns and Scrum concepts.},

	Abstract = {Commercial organisations who have invested in ``greening'' their buildings are not only concerned about reducing the negative impact of their buildings on the environment, but also on the potential positive impact green buildings can have on their employees and therefore also on the financial sustainability of the organisation. To date, the research evidence on the effect of green buildings on employees is equivocal. Widely varying research designs and measures, and differing research foci have resulted in a fragmented and contradictory body of knowledge. In this study, we attempt to bring some order to this field by first, providing a framework for reviewing and evaluating the extant research evidence and second, by starting to address some of the research design flaws identified in the previous research through a longitudinal, empirical investigation of the impact of green building on employees. In the empirical study, three green buildings were evaluated using a pre-test, post test design, repeated-measures design with a contrast group for two of the buildings (Total N = 280). Statistical analyses of the data established that there were significant improvements in perceived air quality across all three buildings, significant improvements in self-report productivity in two of the buildings and a significant improvement in physical wellbeing in one building. However, no significant differences were found for psychological wellbeing, job satisfaction, propensity to leave the organisation, and organisational image. We consider these results to be methodologically robust but suggest caution in interpreting the results due to poor response rates and possible volunteer bias. The results are discussed in relation to the design features of each building.},

	Abstract = {Background
Tobacco smoking is common in patients with allergic rhinitis.
Objective
To examine the impact of smoking on allergic rhinitis.
Methods
Two cross-sectional studies (performed between March 1, 2002, and February 28, 2003) assessed the impact of tobacco smoking on the symptoms and quality of life of untreated patients with diagnosed allergic rhinitis who had consulted with primary care physicians (472 patients) and specialists (672 patients). Both studies used the same methods and were combined. Rhinitis was classified according to the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma initiative. The European Community Respiratory Health Survey questionnaire on smoking and the disease-specific Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) were used.
Results
A total of 20.8% of the patients were smokers and 10.9% were ex-smokers. More than 78% of the patients had moderate to severe symptoms of rhinitis. Fewer patients had moderate to severe nasal pruritus or loss of smell. There appeared to be no significant difference in the severity of nasal symptoms, depending on the smoking status. Moderate to severe nasal obstruction was observed in 78.8% of the nonsmokers, 79.0% of the smokers, and 77.4% of the ex-smokers. Overall and individual domain scores in the RQLQ were not altered by the smoking status. The overall median (25th-75th percentiles) RQLQ score was 2.8 (2.1--3.5) in nonsmokers, 2.7 (2.0--3.5) in smokers, and 2.7 (1.9--3.5) in ex-smokers.
Conclusions
In the present study, which was performed with a large number of untreated patients with a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, smoking was found not to alter nasal symptoms or nasal-specific quality of life.},

In our experience as consultant architects and trainers on software architecture and design in a corporate setting, we find that software engineers have a theoretical understanding of design principles but sorely lack knowledge about how to properly apply them to in real-world situations to achieve high-quality design. This half-day tutorial is geared towards bridging this gap. It first introduces fundamental design principles (viz. abstraction, encapsulation, modularization, and hierarchy) and describes how these can be applied using a set of corresponding enabling techniques. Next, it discusses how design smells can be viewed as violations of these enabling techniques, and explains how these design smells can be refactored via the application of relevant design principles. Finally, it highlights useful tools, processes, and practical techniques that support the application of design principles in real-world software projects.},

	Abstract = {Good compiler diagnostic warnings facilitate software development as they indicate likely programming mistakes or code smells. However, due to compiler bugs, the warnings may be erroneous, superfluous or missing, even for mature production compilers like GCC and Clang. In this paper, we (1) propose the first randomized differential testing technique to detect compiler warning defects and (2) describe our extensive evaluation in finding warning defects in widely-used C compilers.
At the high level, our technique starts with generating random programs to trigger compilers to emit a variety of compiler warnings, aligns the warnings from different compilers, and identifies inconsistencies as potential bugs. We develop effective techniques to overcome three specific challenges: (1) How to generate random programs, (2) how to align textual warnings, and (3) how to reduce test programs for bug reporting?
Our technique is very effective --- we have found and reported 60 bugs for GCC (38 confirmed, assigned or fixed) and 39 for Clang (14 confirmed or fixed). This case study not only demonstrates our technique's effectiveness, but also highlights the need to continue improving compilers' warning support, an essential, but rather neglected aspect of compilers.},

	Abstract = {Although aspect-oriented programming (AOP) aims to improve software maintainability, developers can unwittingly introduce code smells in their programs. A code smell is any symptom in the source code that possibly indicates a deeper maintainability problem. Even though a few code smells for AOP have been reported in the literature, there is no evidence if and how they occur in evolving software projects. There is also little knowledge on their actual impact on maintenance effort, such as required refactorings or corrective changes in later software releases. This paper presents an exploratory analysis of code smells recurrently observed in a set of evolving aspect-oriented systems. We analyzed instances of code smells previously reported in the literature and newly-revealed ones. Our study involved in total 18 releases of 3 evolving aspect-oriented systems from different domains. The outcome of our evaluation suggests that previously-documented AOP smells might not occur as often as claimed. Our analysis also revealed that: (1) newly-discovered code smells might occur more often than well-known ones, and (2) the former ones seemed to be consistently associated with non-trivial refactorings and corrective changes.},

Recent evidence has demonstrated that mixtures of odors share some of the same spatiotemporal features of speech sounds and may use similar brain resources in associating those features with the symbols they represent. This experiment investigated the hypothesis that an odor mixture would interfere with a math task that requires symbolic but not spatial processing. Results indicated the pattern of brain electrical activity was similar for the single odors and the mixture during spatial processing. During solution of the task requiring symbolic processing, the odor mixture produced a pattern of brain electrical activity different from the single odorants. These data suggest that the perception of odor mixtures may use some of the same resources associated with symbolic processing.},

	Abstract = {Smell simulation technology allows humans to use their sense of smell to enhance or accelerate their interaction with computers. The technology can be categorised as being either perceiving or generating odours. In this paper, the major capabilities and application areas of both these categories are highlighted. Typical application areas include the food industry, multimedia, marketing, chemistry, art, medical and health sciences, etc.
Since its first usage in the 1950s, the lack of acceptance and instability of the technology motivated scientists to try to improve the technology and adapt it for human needs. In this study, questionnaires were used to determine whether computer users are ready to accept smell generation as a means of interaction during online shopping. The current social acceptability of the technology as well as the factors which might deter end-user's willingness to use the technology was investigated. It was found that the interest of people in the use of this technology as interaction modality is, to some extent, affected by gender as well as by the amount of Internet experience and that technical difficulties such as cost, potential health risks and lack of accuracy stand in the way of general acceptability.},

	Abstract = {Several recent studies have demonstrated the existence of robust crossmodal correspondences between food and beverage items and shapes varying on the angular-round continuum. To date, however, the majority of this research has involved relatively simple gustatory, oral-somatosensory, and/or olfactory stimuli. In the present study, therefore, we extended this research in order to investigate whether people also exhibit robust crossmodal correspondences between shapes and cheese. To this end, participants in Experiment 1 (conducted at a Gastronomy event) tasted three aged farmhouse cheeses (Keen's Cheddar, Tunworth, & Berkswell, from Neal's Yard Dairy, UK). Participants rated each cheese using a single response scale anchored at either end by a rounded and an angular shape. Significant differences in shape symbolism were observed across the three cheeses. In Experiments 2 (conducted with cheesemongers and cheese experts) and 3 (conducted with customers in a cheese store), participants separately rated the olfactory, gustatory, and oral-somatosensory attributes of different cheeses (Tunworth, Lancashire, and Stawley) on the angular-round continuum. The results revealed that participants' crossmodal correspondences were based primarily on the taste, rather than the smell or texture of the cheeses. Implications of these findings for the marketing of dairy products are discussed.
Practical applications
The results of the present study demonstrate that taste is the leading contributor to the systematic associations consumers have between the flavors of cheese and certain angular/sharp or organic/round shapes and speech sounds, with the same pattern of crossmodal correspondences being held across different tasting groups (non-experts, regular consumers, and cheesemongers/experts). These results provide insights regarding the abstract imagery that might best be associated with specific taste attributes in commercial cheeses. These results may also be used to not only develop abstract imagery for product packaging that can capture specific shape/sound symbolic properties, but also to develop descriptors that can provide a common ground on which to talk about cheeses, thereby improving communication between different panels of cheese tasters.},

	Abstract = {Olfaction has recently been gaining attention in information and communication technology, as shown by attempts in theaters to screen videos while emitting scents. However, because there is no current infrastructure to communicate and synchronize odor information with visual information, people cannot enjoy this experience at home. Therefore, we have constructed a system of smell videos which could be applied to television (TV), allowing viewers to experience scents while watching their videos. To solve the abovementioned technical problems, we propose using the existing system for broadcasting closed caption. Our system's implementation is mindful of both video viewers and producers, allowing the system on the viewer end to disperse odorants in synchronization with videos, and allowing producers to add odor information to videos. We finally verify the system's feasibility. We expect that this study will make smell videos become common, and people will enjoy ones in daily life in the near future.},

	Abstract = {Visual experience is information rich, but only a small proportion is available for later access. We tested for this distinction in olfaction. In two experiments (E1&2), participants undertook trials rating an odor's features (e.g., how banana-like?), the during-smelling-profile, followed by an after-smelling-profile, upon the odor's removal. On some trials during and after-smelling-profiles were identical and on others they were different. Each trial with a particular odor was repeated. For half the odors both trials were identical (congruent) and for the remainder, one was different and the other identical (incongruent). Crucially, the after-smelling-profile was always the same for each odor, allowing reliability to be measured. E1&2 revealed that incongruent profiles were the least reliable. Attempting to access particular odor features in an odor's absence is harder if those features were not attended during smelling. This suggests more information is available during smelling, than can be accessed after the odors removal.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an empirical study whose goal was to investigate the exception handling strategies adopted by Java libraries and their potential impact on the client applications. In this study, exception flow analysis was used in combination with manual inspections in order: (i) to characterize the exception handling strategies of existing Java libraries from the perspective of their users; and (ii) to identify exception handling anti-patterns. We extended an existing static analysis tool to reason about exception flows and handler actions of 656 Java libraries selected from 145 categories in the Maven Central Repository. The study findings suggest a current trend of a high number of undocumented API runtime exceptions (i.e., @throws in Javadoc) and Unintended Handler problem. Moreover, we could also identify a considerable number of occurrences of exception handling anti-patterns (e.g. Catch and Ignore). Finally, we have also analyzed 647 bug issues of the 7 most popular libraries and identified that 20.71% of the reports are defects related to the problems of the exception strategies and anti-patterns identified in our study. The results of this study point to the need of tools to better understand and document the exception handling behavior of libraries.},

	Abstract = {Lawns have a significant influence on the cityscape as one of the essential elements of green spaces and an important part of people's everyday lives. Most people in the Western world view lawns as a compulsory element of the urban landscape, almost an icon, without questioning their social, symbolic, ecological or aesthetic values. This research is a part of the conceptual framework and methodological approaches that are being used in an ongoing transdisciplinary collaboration project to study lawns in Sweden as a social and ecological phenomenon. The overall aim of this study was to investigate social and cultural perceptions of lawns, as well as motives behind decisions about the establishment and management of lawns in Sweden. Two multi-family housing typologies, the `Million Programme' and `People's Homes', were examined due to their dominance in Swedish cities. We also studied how an alternative vision of conventional lawns can be applied and accepted by urban residents. We estimated lawn cover in multi-family housing areas and links to people's perception and use of lawns. Questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and observational studies were used (N=300). Our results showed that people like lawns even if they do not always directly use them. Lawns cover the most significant amount of outdoor spaces in all multi-family residential areas and accompany people everywhere from the house to the schoolyard or park. The total lawn cover in the study areas was 27.8%. Lawns were particularly valued as important places for different outdoor activities (playing, resting, picnicking, walking, socialising) and enjoying the green colour. However people do not want to use a vast monotonous lawn, but a variety of spaces that provide good conditions for different senses (sound, smell, touch and sight) and activities. Alternative lawns were also appreciated by many citizens, politicians, planners and managers. The implementation of new types of lawns requires special planning and design solutions adjusted for each particular neighbourhood.},

	Abstract = {The supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of the omega-3 rich oil contained in by-products of the fish industry has been studied in this work. Specifically, the offcuts obtained from peeling hake (Merluccius capensis--Merluccius paradoxus) to obtain hake fillets have been used as raw material. This raw material was grounded to different sizes and freeze-dried to different moisture contents. Extraction experiments were carried out at different pressure, flow rate and flow sense in order to study the influence of such process parameters on the extraction rate and oil quality. The influence of continuous or intermittent contact solvent--subtract was also evaluated. The extraction temperature was maintained at 40$\,^{\circ}$C in all cases in order to avoid thermal degradation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in hake oil. The results obtained indicate that internal mass transfer controlled the rate of the process under the conditions studied in this work. The optimum extraction conditions were found to be 25MPa, 10kgCO2/h and upflow sense over freeze-dried and grounded hake. Under those conditions, more than 96% of the total oil contained in the raw material was extracted after 3h. The oil extracted presented a high omega-3/omega-6 ratio (around 7) and a high EPA and DHA content (about 6% and 14%, respectively, of the total fatty acids contained in the hake by-product used in this work). Quality and stability of the hake oil were evaluated along 14 days of storage under different conditions. The acidity of hake oil obtained by SFE was high, but it was similar or even lower than the acidity of the oil obtained by conventional solvent extraction. Acidity suffered little further increment along storage. Hake oil was very prone to oxidative modification, enhanced by increasing temperature and light. The oil oxidation process is complex affecting the concentration of parameters related both with primary and secondary steps of oxidation and to sensory properties as smell and colour.},

Drosophila melanogaster is a useful organism for studying the neural mechanisms of these navigation behaviors. There are a wealth of genetic tools in this organism, as well as a history of inventive behavioral experiments. There is also a large and growing literature in Drosophila on the neural coding of olfactory, visual, and mechanosensory stimuli. Here we review recent progress in understanding how these stimulus modalities are encoded in the Drosophila nervous system. We also discuss what strategies a fly might use to navigate in a natural olfactory landscape while making use of all these sources of sensory information. We emphasize that Drosophila are likely to switch between multiple strategies for olfactory navigation, depending on the availability of various sensory cues. Finally, we highlight future research directions that will be important in understanding the neural circuits that underlie these behaviors.},

	Abstract = {Tire pyrolysis oil was produced by EnerVision Inc., Halifax, Canada using the continuous ablative reactor (CAR) system. The tire oil was separated by distillation into several fractions. Naphtha and limonene enriched naphtha were reacted with methanol over different catalysts. Batch experiments were carried out to separate limonene as methyl limonene ethers. Whole tire pyrolysis oil was distilled and the resulting distillates were redistilled to separate the limonene (bp about 176$\,^{\circ}$C). Vacuum distillation yielded on average 25.5wt% naphtha containing 16.3wt% limonene (average). Redistillation increased the limonene concentration to approximately 32--37wt%. The conversion of limonene (mono-terpene) to limonene ethers (terpenoides) shifted the boiling point of the limonene derivatives out of the naphtha boiling range (IBP −190$\,^{\circ}$C). This allowed the separation of fragrant limonene ethers from foul smelling naphtha. Alkoxylation reactions were performed mostly using methanol and acidic catalysts. The methyl ether [1-methyl-4-(α-methoxy-isopropyl)-1-cyclohexene] has a boiling point of about 198$\,^{\circ}$C which is higher than the end boiling point of the naphtha cut. Five heterogeneous catalysts (four zeolites and one ion exchange resin) were tested in a batch reactor. β-Zeolite produced excellent results. The reaction of R-(+)-limonene with methanol in the presence of activated β-zeolite yielded methyl ether, 87.5% at selectivity 89.7% with a maximum of 2h reaction time. Limonene conversion from whole naphtha to ethers was also high.},

	Abstract = {During courtship, specific signals are transmitted and received between the male and the female. To understand the evolution and function of courtship behaviours, these signals must be tested individually to determine their relative effects. Drosophila species have a variety of courtship patterns that use different sensory modalities, including chemosensory, tactile, visual and auditory cues, and thus provide an opportunity for exploring different sensory modalities. In most species of the Drosophila willistoni group, males produce an auditory cue (courtship song) through wing vibration. One species, Drosophila nebulosa, does not produce an auditory signal in courtship, although both sexes perform wing-lifting movements and males fan an anal droplet towards the female. We compared the sensory modalities important for mating success in D. nebulosa and D. willistoni through a series of phenotypic manipulation experiments in which individuals had disrupted transmission or reception of signals. In D. nebulosa, females had to be able to smell, presumably to detect the anal droplet, for successful mating to occur, whereas for males of the same species, vision was essential. In contrast, no single sensory modality was absolutely necessary for D. willistoni mating success, although hearing greatly increased mating success for females and courtship song greatly increased mating success for males. Thus, these species are divergent in the sensory modalities necessary for courtship success, indicating that courtship behaviour may change rapidly within species groups.},

Investigating the extent to which the green aroma affects the perception of bitterness in virgin olive oil may affect the identification of new strategies for optimising the sensory properties of the product. The study was organised in four stages: a pre-testing stage verified the suitability of the tastant (quinine dihydrochloride) and the odorant (cis-3-hexen-1-ol) and to select a moderate concentration of the cut grass odour and a spread of different concentrations of the bitter compound ranging from weak to strong. A second stage studied the effect of the cut grass odour on the intensity of bitterness perceived in the oil and on the oil's pleasantness (experiment 1). A third stage studied the influence of the cut grass odour on the dynamic process of the perception of bitterness (experiment 2). A fourth stage, to stimulate a nose-occlusion control condition, verified the sensory nature of the interaction between the odorant and tastant (experiment 3). The results show that the green odour note has a positive significant effect on the perception of bitterness. The presence of cut grass odour enhances the bitterness perception. New strategies in controlling the perceived intensity of bitterness in virgin olive oil may be defined.},

Architectural design decisions have been identified as being critical for achieving high levels of software system security. However the majority of this research has been anecdotal and there are few tools or methods for understanding the architectural relations among files, and their impact on security. In this paper we employ a DRSpace-based analysis approach to identify architectural design flaws and we show, via an empirical study of 10 open source projects, that areas of a software architecture that suffer from greater numbers of design flaws are highly correlated with security bugs, and high levels of churn associated with those security bugs. Finally, we show that a specific type of design flaw -- unstable interface -- is correlated with the greatest increase in software security bugs.},

	Abstract = {In some countries, alcohol-based hand gels are used for hygienic hand disinfection but their efficacy and suitability for surgical hand disinfection has never been investigated. The efficacy of Sterillium Gel{\texttrademark} was investigated according to prEN 12791 in two separate experiments. Finger tips of 20 volunteers per experiment were sampled for resident skin bacteria before surgical hand disinfection. In a cross-over design, each volunteer carried out a surgical hand disinfection with the reference alcohol [n-propanol 60%, (v/v)] or Sterillium Gel{\texttrademark} [ethanol 85% (v/v)] for 3 min. After the product application, one hand was sampled for the immediate effect, the other hand was gloved for 3 h and then sampled for the sustained effect. Samples were analysed for remaining resident bacteria. The mean of the pre-value, the 0 h and 3 h values of the reference disinfection and the test product were calculated. With the reference alcohol, respective mean immediate log10-reduction factors of 2.06$\pm$0.76 and 2.23$\pm$1.13 were found in both experiments. The mean sustained effects with the reference alcohol were 2.03$\pm$1.14 and 1.44$\pm$0.81. Sterillium Gel{\texttrademark} achieved respective mean immediate effects of 2.48$\pm$1.06 and 2.13$\pm$0.81, the mean sustained effects were 2.77$\pm$0.95 and 2.18$\pm$0.72. They proved significantly larger than those obtained with the reference alcohol (P<0.05; pair-wise Wilcoxon test). Sterillium Gel{\texttrademark}, therefore, more than fulfils the efficacy requirements for surgical hand disinfection of prEN 12791. In addition, 25 of 26 operating theatre healthcare workers in an orthopaedic hospital found it suitable for surgical hand disinfection after a single use, which included putting on a pair of surgical gloves. Although none of them had ever used an alcohol-based gel before, they had rather been accustomed to alcohol-based liquid products for years. The main reasons given for the positive assessment were better skin feeling after use, smell and easier donning of the surgical gloves. No significant correlation was found between overall or dermal acceptance and years of professional experience, profession or number of gel portions used for surgical hand disinfection (Pearson's correlation; P>0.05).},

Existing techniques are not effective to identify refactoring opportunities because of the complexity of composite refactoring and the behavior preservation for Aspect-Oriented refactoring. To address these challenges, we design EXTRACTOR, which is an extensible framework to identify Aspect-Oriented refactoring opportunities. In the framework, the bad smell detector provides significant query ability to detect bad smells, while the template manager enables the customization of bad smell and composite refactoring. Then refactoring opportunities are identified using logic transformation managed by EXTRACTOR Constructor. All these functionalities are based on the logic query engine, which manages the logic representation of programs. Finally we illustrate the effectiveness of the framework using case study.},

The countryside embraces local resources rich in multi-sensory stimuli that could be utilized in the planning and marketing of appealing tourist experiences addressed to segments of tourists, while fitting sustainable local development. This study follows a holistic approach to the five external human senses, aiming to capture meaningful sensory-informed themes adequate for segmenting rural tourists. A self-administered survey in four languages was collected from 181 tourists in Southwest Portugal. A multiple correspondence analysis suggests four sensory-informed themes, tentatively named generic beach-related experience, nature-based experience, balanced experience, and rural experience. The proposed themes correspond to a four-solution cluster of tourists presenting different profiles. The largest segment (73 tourists) corresponds to the rural experience, regarding which tourists mainly refer to the taste of local food and the smell of fresh air.},

The goal of the empirical study reported in this paper is to exploratory characterize the state of IAC with respect to a set of challenges, patterns and anti-patterns identified by a recent Systematic Literature Review study. To address the above goal, we gathered the opinions of researchers and practitioners w.r.t. their experiences in IAC projects. Our dataset includes 47 opinion data points related to a large set of projects conducted in 10 different countries. We aim to contribute to the body of evidence in the area of IAC, for the benefit of researchers and practitioners in conducting future successful IAC projects in SE. As an output, the study presents a set of empirical findings and evidence-based recommendations to increase the success of IAC projects.},

	Abstract = {Having dinner together is undoubtedly a kind of pleasurable experience, which involves various channels for mutual interactions, not only audio, vision and touch, but also smell and taste. With the aim to extend this rich experience to remote situations, we developed the Co-dining system to support a range of mealtime interactions to enhance the feeling of social togetherness. This paper describes the preliminary study with this interactive multisensory system. It aims to investigate the actual effectiveness of the working prototype on enhancing the social presence and engagement during telepresent dining, and also to get a comprehensive understanding about users' perception. This evaluation focused on three main aspects: the overall Co-dining feeling, cultural awareness, and engagement. The study results revealed that this system positively achieved the sense of "being together" among users, through the interactive activities touching upon tableware, tablecloth and real edible food, and each interaction module contributed differently to the overall experience. In this paper, we report the evaluation process, present and interpret the data, and discuss the initial insights to enhance the sense of co-presence through multi-channel interactions.},

	Abstract = {Olfactory impairment is a characteristic of early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). Over 95% of PD patients present with severe olfactory loss. Almost all olfactory tests are subjective. Therefore, olfactometry cannot be performed unless the patient himself/herself notices olfactory impairment. When the condition of the patients was diagnosed as a PD, they had completely lost their sense of olfaction. Thus, an objective olfactory test is required to measure the olfactory function of patients with PD. In this study, we examined the subjective olfactory test (T&T olfactometry) and the objective olfactory test (cerebral blood volume changes under odor stimulation by using near-infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]) in PD patients and age-matched elder normosmic volunteers. The results of the subjective and objective olfactory tests of PD patients were significantly worse than those of the normal volunteers. These results suggested that most of the PD patients had olfactory impairment and half of the PD patients did not notice their olfactory impairment. In case of the latter group of patients, subjective olfactometry is not useful. The objective olfactory test is required to measure the olfactory function of patients with PD. Multi-channel NIRS is expected to be widely used in the future for clinical objective olfactometry. Olfactometry may be an early screening test for the diagnosis of PD.},

	Abstract = {Code smells are associated with poor coding practices that cause long-term maintainability problems and mask bugs. Despite mobile being a fast growing software sector, code smells in mobile applications have been understudied. We do not know how code smells in mobile applications compare to those in desktop applications, and how code smells are affecting the design of mobile applications. Without such knowledge, application developers, tool builders, and researchers cannot improve the practice and state of the art of mobile development.We first reviewed the literature on code smells in Android applications and found that there is a significant gap between the most studied code smells in literature and most frequently occurring code smells in real world applications. Inspired by this finding, we conducted a large scale empirical study to compare the type, density, and distribution of code smells in mobile vs. desktop applications. We analyze an open-source corpus of 500 Android applications (total of 6.7M LOC) and 750 desktop Java applications (total of 16M LOC), and compare 14,553 instances of code smells in Android applications to 117,557 instances of code smells in desktop applications. We find that, despite mobile applications having different structure and workflow than desktop applications, the variety and density of code smells is similar. However, the distribution of code smells is different - some code smells occur more frequently in mobile applications. We also found that different categories of Android applications have different code smell distributions. We highlight several implications of our study for application developers, tool builders, and researchers.},

	Abstract = {Spreadsheets are widely used by end users for numerical computation in their business. Spreadsheet cells whose computation is subject to the same semantics are often clustered in a row or column as a cell array. When a spreadsheet evolves, the cells in a cell array can degenerate due to ad hoc modifications. Such degenerated cell arrays no longer keep cells prescribing the same computational semantics, and are said to exhibit ambiguous computation smells. We propose CACheck, a novel technique that automatically detects and repairs smelly cell arrays by recovering their intended computational semantics. Our empirical study on the EUSES and Enron corpora finds that such smelly cell arrays are common. Our study also suggests that CACheck is useful for detecting and repairing real spreadsheet problems caused by smelly cell arrays. Compared with our previous work AmCheck, CACheck detects smelly cell arrays with higher precision and recall rate.},

	Abstract = {The feeling of presence has been shown to be an important concept in several clinical applications of virtual reality. Among the factors influencing presence, realism factors have been examined extensively from the angle of objective realism. Objective realism has been manipulated by altering numerous technological characteristics such as pictorial quality, texture and shading, or by adding more sensory information (i.e., smell, touch). Much less studied is the subjective (or perceived) realism, the focus of the two pilot studies reported in this article. In Study 1, subjective realism was manipulated in order to assess the impact on the feeling of presence. Method: Presence was measured in 31 adults after two immersions in virtual reality. Participants were immersed in a neutral/irrelevant virtual environment and subsequently subjected to the experimental manipulation. Participants in the experimental condition were falsely led to believe that they were immersed live in real time in a ``real'' room with a ``real'' mouse in a cage. In the control condition, participants believed they were immersed in a replica of the nearby room. All participants were actually immersed in the exact same virtual environment. Results: A manipulation check revealed that 80% of the participants believed in the deception. A 2 Times by 2 Conditions repeated measure ANOVA revealed that leading people to believe they were seeing a real environment digitized live in virtual reality increased their feeling of presence compared to the control condition. In Study 2, the same experimental design was used but with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to assess brain areas potentially related to the feeling of presence. fMRI data from five participants were subjected to a within subject fixed effect analysis to verify differences between the experimental immersion (higher presence) and the control immersion (lower presence). Results revealed a statistically significant difference in left and right parahippocampus areas. Conclusion: Results are discussed according to layers of presence and consciousness and the meaning given to experiences occurring in virtual reality. Some suggestions are formulated to target core presence and extended presence.},

	Abstract = {Bad Smells are certain structures in the software which violates the design principles and ruin the software quality. In order to deals with the bad smells, often refactoring treatment is provided in the code which further improves the software quality. However, it's not possible to refactor each and every class of the software in maintenance phase due to certain deadlines. Prioritization of classes helps the developer to identify the software portions requiring urgent refactoring. In the current study, we propose a framework to identify the potential classes which immediately require refactoring based on the bad smells as well as design characteristics. We evaluate our approach on medium sized open-source systems ORDrumbox. Four types of code-smells Feature Envy, Long Method, God Class and Type Checking were identified and well known Chidamber and Kemerer metric suite is used to evaluate the object oriented characteristics. Both are combined in certain ratio to calculate new proposed metric Quality Depreciation Index Rule (QDIR) for each class. Classes are further arranged as per their QDIR values to identify the severely affected classes requiring immediate refactoring treatment. This study works on 80:20 principles conveying 80% of the code quality can be improved by just providing refactoring treatment to 20% of the severely affected classes. Results reflects that the bad smells and design metrics can be used as an important source of information to quantify the flaws in the classes, thus helpful to maintainers in performing their task under strict time constraints while maintaining the overall software quality.},

	Abstract = {While rodents have a keen sense of smell and largely depend on olfactory cues for operating in their environment, most of the widely used tests to assess anxiety-related behavior largely ignore the olfactory system, being primarily based on fear of brightly lit, novel and open spaces. Here, we aimed at testing whether the genetic predisposition to anxiety predicts the predator odor response in mice. In the first experiment, using the 3-chamber avoidance test in CD-1 mice, trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a synthetic fox fecal odor, was shown to induce stronger behavioral and neuroendocrine effects than cat odor and butyric acid, respectively, and was therefore chosen as aversive odor for the following series of experiments. In this series, bidirectionally, selectively inbred CD-1 mice with either high (HAB), intermediate (NAB) or low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior responded differently to TMT, with HABs spending significantly less time than both NABs and LABs in the chamber harbouring the predator odor. Importantly, this result is not confounded by any deficit of the olfactory system, as LAB and NAB mice, while not or only moderately responding to TMT, responded to both the pleasant odor of female urine and the repugnant odor of butyric acid. Probably due to the strength of TMT, a similar increase in corticosterone levels upon predator odor exposure was observed in all three groups. Together, the results suggest that, dependent on the genetic predisposition to extremes in anxiety-related behavior, mice differentially interpret the odor of a potential predator, making this type of avoidance behavior highly predictable.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents experimentally based rules and methods for the creation of harmonic color sets. First, dichromatic rules are presented which concern the harmony relationships of two hues. For an arbitrarily given hue pair, we define the just harmonic saturation values, resulting in minimally harmonic color pairs. These values express the fuzzy border between harmony and disharmony regions using a single scalar. Second, the value of harmony is defined corresponding to the contrast of lightness, i.e. the difference of perceptual lightness values. Third, we formulate the harmony value of the saturation contrast, depending on hue and lightness. The results of these investigations form a basis for a unified, coherent dichromatic harmony formula as well as for analysis of polychromatic color harmony. Introduced color harmony rules are based on Coloroid, which is one of the 5 - 6 main color-order systems and furthermore it is an aesthetically uniform continuous color space. Coloroid has simple closed forward and backward transformation formulas with the color space of CIE XYZ. It relies on a huge number of observations and experiments, and it is a very suitable tool of color dynamics for describing aesthetical relationships. It has been used in numerous architectural projects. The experimental data that may be retrieved from them are only partly processed and published so far. Our article utilizes a 'slice' of this database, together with additional complementary observations. This paper is the first of a planned series of articles, dealing with rules and coherences of color harmony based on the Coloroid system.},

@article{POPOV2012232,
	Abstract = {Background
The proportion of patients visiting general practitioners (GPs), otorhinolaryngologists (ORLs), and allergologists (ALRGs) for nasal complaints is unknown but important in estimating the number of subjects with nasal symptoms bothersome enough to warrant physician consultations and assessing nasal pathological conditions' burden on a national health care system.
Objective
The Symptoms of Nasal Inconvenience Fact Finding (SNIFF) survey was developed to (1) assess incidence of physician visits attributable to nasal complaints; (2) characterize patients' nasal conditions; and (3) outline differences across physician categories.
Methods
The SNIFF survey was completed over 20 days by Bulgarian GPs, ORLs, and ALRGs whom patients consulted for nasal symptoms. Survey forms differentiated type and severity of patients' conditions according to Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines and ranked bothersome symptoms. Smell impairment, comorbidities, and prescription practices were documented.
Results
Sixty-nine physicians (30 GPs, 8 ORLs, 31 ALRGs) completed 1,685 surveys. The proportion of patients with nasal symptoms over the total patients seen was 15.7%: ALRGs, 18.0%; GPs, 14.6%; ORLs, 13.1%. Patients were classified as having intermittent (38.8%) or persistent (61.2%) rhinitis, with most having moderate/severe symptoms (94.4%). Congestion was the leading symptom in 59.1%. Smell was impaired in 69.8% of patients, asthma was present in 21.4%, and cough in 62.9%. ALRGs were more likely to diagnose and manage patients per ARIA guidelines than were ORLs or GPs.
Conclusion
The SNIFF survey results demonstrate congestion's role as a leading symptom motivating patients to seek medical advice. SNIFF also uncovered differences in practices among different categories of health care providers.},

	Abstract = {Purpose
Taste and smell alterations (TSAs) are common symptoms in patients with cancer that may interfere with nutritional intake and quality of life. In this study, we explore and describe how characteristics of self-reported TSAs change in individuals with lung cancer over time using a multiple case study approach to present longitudinal data from individuals.
Methods
Patients under investigation for lung cancer were recruited from one university hospital in Sweden. The 52 patients providing data eligible for the analyses presented here were those treated for primary lung cancer with three measurement time-points, of which one was prior to treatment and two after treatment start. Four self-report instruments were used for data collection. These included the Taste and Smell Survey, used to characterize TSAs for each individual at the three time-points and instruments measuring nutritional status, symptom burden and well-being. Three patient cases are described in detail to illustrate variation in individual experiences of TSAs.
Results
The characteristics of the TSAs experienced changed over time for many of the individuals in this study, including those undergoing surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy. The case descriptions show how the individual experiences of TSAs and the impact on daily life of these symptoms not only depend on TSA characteristics, but may be influenced by contextual factors, e.g. other symptoms and life situation.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that healthcare professionals need to consider the variation in characteristics of TSAs among and within patients over time, and be attentive to individual experiences of TSAs.},

	Abstract = {Bacterial protein meal (BPM) produced on natural gas was evaluated with respect to growth, nutrient digestibilities, feed conversion ratios, sensory quality, and histopathological indices in Atlantic salmon in saltwater. In the extruded diets, experimentally produced BPM accounted for 0, 10, or 20% of the ingredients or 0, 17.2, or 33.1% of dietary nitrogen, replacing high-quality fish meal. Each diet was fed to two groups of salmon with a mean initial weight of 1.4 kg for 5 months. The pens were organized in two randomized blocks. One block was located with one side of the pens exposed to the open sea. The other block was completely surrounded by other pens. During the experiment, the salmon increased to approximately 3.6--3.9 kg in weight. Analysis of variance revealed no significant (P>0.05) differences in growth, but regression analysis showed that fish weights at 2 and 5 months and growth rates for the whole experiment were slightly reduced with increasing content of BPM. No significant effects of diet were seen on dressed-out carcass, liver, or intestine to body weight percentages. Carcass and visceral fat and dry matter contents decreased with increasing dietary BPM. There was a trend (0.10≤P<0.05) that apparent digestibilities of nitrogen, fat, and energy were reduced when substituting fish meal with BPM, while the nitrogen retention was not significantly affected. Flesh carotenoid concentration and colour were not significantly affected by dietary composition, nor were any differences seen for sensory characteristics related to taste, smell or texture. Histological examination did not reveal abnormalities, or signs of allergic reaction against BPM components, and hematocrit values were within normal ranges. Significant block effects were seen for chemical composition of viscera, and digestibilities of nitrogen, fat, and energy.},

	Abstract = {Disharmony in China primarily reflected in the income, education, employment. The research object of this paper was crime in social security incidents. Income inequality and education has been viewed as having important impact on crime. Many literatures reported that higher income inequality is associated with higher crime rates. Some literatures concluded education development can raise the residents' income level and reduce income inequality, thereby result in slower crime growth. In China, residents' income has increased largely. But at the same time, GINI coefficient has continued to improve in recent years, and the crime rate has continually increased. This paper analyzed the long-run and short-run relationships between property crime rate and income inequality, education, unemployment, based on vector error correction model. Variables in the model included per capita annual disposable income of Chinese urban households, GINI coefficient, and enrolment rate of junior secondary graduates entering senior secondary schools and unemployment rate. Data used are time series data from 1978 to 2007 in China. The result confirms the existence of long-run equilibrium relationship between income inequality, education and crime. And income and income inequality effect change in crime rate in short-run significantly.},

	Abstract = {In this study, the effect of thermal and photochemical accelerated degradation on the deterioration pathways of cellulose diacetate was evaluated. The degradation induced under controlled experimental conditions was carefully monitored in order to investigate the correlation between specific degradation mechanisms and the visible signs of deterioration that are often encountered on cellulose acetate museum objects. In the time interval studied, thermally degraded samples did not show visible discoloration or noticeable vinegar smell, but appeared severely distorted. Samples degraded under UVA radiation did not show any significant sign of deterioration, while samples degraded under UVB and UVC radiations appeared discolored and released the typical vinegar odor. Samples degraded under UVB radiation were also brittle and prone to crazing. By monitoring the samples as they deteriorated over time, new insights into the degradation mechanisms were obtained. During thermal degradation, the experimental results showed that plasticizer diffusion through the polymer matrix is affected by the progressive loss of plasticizer that occurred during the degradation experiment. During photo-degradation experiments, yellowness induced by UVC and UVB radiations was found to be reversible by subsequent exposure to UVA radiation, while the depth of the degradation appeared to be one of the key factors that led to brittleness and the appearance of crazing.},

	Abstract = {Successful software products evolve continuously to meet the changing stakeholder requirements. For software product lines, an additional challenge is that variabilities, characteristics that vary among products, change as well over time. That challenge must be carefully tackled during the evolution of the product line infrastructure. This is a significant problem for many software development organizations, as practical guidelines on how to evolve core assets, and especially source code, are missing.
This paper investigates how to achieve "good enough" variability management during the evolution of variation in software design and implementation assets. As a first contribution, we present a customizable goal-based approach which helps to identify improvement potential in existing core assets to ease evolution. To find concrete ways to improve the product line infrastructure, we list the typical symptoms of variability "code smells" and show how to refine them to root causes, questions, and finally to metrics that can be extracted from large code bases.
As a second main contribution, we show how this method was applied to evaluate the reuse quality of three industrial embedded systems. These systems are implemented in C or C++ and use Conditional Compilation as the main variability mechanism. We also introduce the analysis and refactoring tool set that was used in the case studies and discuss the lessons learnt.},

	Abstract = {Current software development trends have shortened release cycles and forced developers to implement short-term solutions that cannot cope with increasing product complexity. This phenomenon of introducing hasty design choices or applying bad design practices becomes something known as technical debt, in particular design debt. To pay off this debt, the literature offers approaches for identifying these design flaws; however, few methods for properly prioritizing investment efforts are available. In this paper, we propose an approach that supports the decision-making process regarding design improvements. It identifies violations of design best practices that are then arranged within a two-dimensional portfolio matrix. This matrix combines the importance of practices of design quality with actual achievement relative to a benchmark suite. To show the application of the approach in a quality-improvement process, we performed a feasibility study on three open-source projects and a benchmark suite containing 50 projects. This study clearly shows that the importance of the design best practices greatly impacts the improvement decisions and must be aligned with the strategic quality goals of the product.},

	Abstract = {The paper reports an improved method for electronic nose that combines two identical or very similar sensor arrays mounted into two packages, each containing one array. The distance between the measured sensor signals of the odor samples is then analyzed by two independent but identical sensor arrays. The difference of the appropriate sensor signals generated by both arrays is subject to 2-dimensional convolution, greatly enhancing the sensitivity of the nose. The presented system is called the ``differential electronic nose'' (DEN-nose). The experiments of the recognition of the cigarette smells have proved that the proposed nose system based on the difference of data, generated by two different sensor arrays have significantly enhanced the ability of E-nose for recognition of the close odors.},

@article{OKUNLOLA2009247,
	Abstract = {Objective
To investigate IUD-related vaginitis in IUD users at the University College Hospital Ibadan, South-western Nigeria.
Methods
A prospective cohort study in IUD users present with abnormal vaginal discharge at the family planning clinic of the University College Hospital, Ibadan was conducted between 10th of October, 2008 and 31st of May 2009. High Vaginal Swabs were taken from the clients for microbiology, culture and drug sensitivity test. Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was made based on gram stained vaginal smear using the standard Nugents criteria. Other aetiological agents were identified either on wet preparation or culture using standard techniques. Treatment given was by the family planning nurse, as was the protocol at the family planning clinic.
Results
Twenty-four IUD users present at the family planning clinic with vaginal discharge were studied. Their ages ranged 28--51 years(38.14 $\pm$ 5.9 years). Mean parity was 4.4 $\pm$ 1.4. All the women were married and all used CuT 380A. The mean duration of IUCD use was 2.5 years only. Majority (46%) had used it for more than 3 years and most (75%) of the visits were unscheduled. All the clients complained of abnormal vaginal discharge which was copious, watery and foul smelling, or clumpy. Nine users (37.5%) complained of pruritus vulvae, 3 users (12.5%) lower abdominal pain, 1 user (4.2%) dyspareunia and 1 (4.2%) dysuria. The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was made in 16 (66.7%) and vaginal candidiasis in 8 (33.3%). Age less than 40 years, Christianity and IUD use more than 3 years were associated with a higher risk of bacterial vaginosis (OR=1.29, 1.67 and 6.6, respectively), while women above 40 years, Muslims and women with lower educational status had a higher risk of candida-related vaginitis (OR=1.67 and 4.2, respectively). Eight clients (33.3%) were treated for candidiasis with antifungals (3 empirically, and 5 after obtaining results of vaginal swab), 9 (37.5%) were given oral metronidazole, 3 patients were referred to the gynaecological emergency unit on account of abdominal pain and 4 did not return for follow up.
Conclusion
IUD associated vaginitis is a disturbing condition causing unscheduled visits among IUD users. Bacterial vaginosis and Candidia albicans are major aetiologies in south western Nigeria Ibadan. Persistent discharge is a documented reason for discontinuation of IUD use. Periodic empirical treatment for candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis with antifungals and oral metronidazole is advocated. This may reduce the discomfort caused by IUD-related vaginitis, the risk of PID and other risks exposed to the IUD users and ensure continued use of the IUD.},

@article{FALK2014248,
	Abstract = {The development of attractive and competitive products is not a question of unique features but of best quality for money. However, defining `quality' from the customers' perspective and controlling it throughout the product development process is a fuzzy and arduous task. Especially for producers of exchangeable consumer durables, which are, simultaneously, fighting cost pressure and shortening product and technology life cycles. To solve this dilemma of speed and focus, a proper methodology is needed to enhance customer orientation and systematically integrate customer requirements into the product development process. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and its derivates represent trailblazers for this kind of systematic, quality focused and customer oriented product development. Nevertheless they are largely dependent on the quality of their input. The ``resolution'' of requirements is crucial for the outcome. In case of single sensual perceptions as haptics or optics this challenge becomes obvious. An appropriate survey method to identify requirements regarding those sensations can be found with food science. Sensory studies for the description and discrimination of single-sense impressions are used to evaluate and improve new products, usually regarding taste and smell. The paper presents the integration of Descriptive Analysis (DA) and QFD for the case of surface haptics. Next to the fact that DA is rather new to the investigation of haptics, the integration demands a matching of steps and a combination of quantitative (DA) and qualitative (QFD) approaches. Nevertheless, this traceable and repeatable proceeding allows for an impact driven resource deployment and, for this reason, a more effective product development process, as well as a sustainable improvement in perceived product quality. A case of leather surfaces serves as an example for this matter.},

	Abstract = {This study aimed to assess the influence of two label conditions on the acceptance of boar meat. A central location test was conducted with 145 consumers each assessing 4 pieces of pork loin. Samples varied with respect to two factors: actual meat type (boar vs. standard pork) and label information (young boar meat vs. pork). Androstenone and skatole levels in the tested boar meat ranged from 0.51 to 2.72μg/g and 0.01 to 0.23μg/g melted fat, respectively. Consumers' sensitivity to and appreciation of androstenone and skatole odour was determined through a smell experiment. The acceptance of taste, tenderness, juiciness, and overall liking was neither influenced by the label information nor by the meat type. Twenty-seven % of all participants were classified as insensitive to androstenone odour, whereas 52% perceived it as positive and 21% as negative. Consumers who disliked the androstenone odour indicated a higher disliking of boar meat.},

@article{HEINONEN2012248,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a new method, the Futures Window (FW), where visual weak signals are used to trigger futures thinking and innovation in organisations [1]. Weak signals are signs anticipating or pointing to possibly emerging new issues. Weak signals can be perceived through all five human senses: they can be seen, heard, smelled, felt or even tasted. Visual weak signals are weak signals shown in a visual form. They can be represented as images: photos, paintings, drawings, video clips, etc. [2]. The method used by the Futures Window is to display weak signals in a visual form as a slide show on a large screen with the aim of encouraging people to anticipate and innovate futures. The Futures Window could be a central tool to be used in Creative Foresight Spaces (CFS).11The idea for the concept of Creative Foresight Space originated during two research projects ``Technology Futures Forum'' and ``SOMED'' (Social media at the crossroads of physical, virtual and digital worlds), initiated by Dr. Sirkka Heinonen, and first described in the conference presentation by Toni Ahlqvist, Minna Halonen and Sirkka Heinonen ``Social Media Applications for Innovative Working Environments'' 9th International Conference of Finland Futures Research Centre and Finland Futures Academy Culture and Innovation -- The search for Creative Power in Economics and Societies. Session on Social Media and Technology I. 6--8 June 2007, Turku, Finland. See also p. 68 of the report ``Making Sense of Social media -- Interviews and Narratives'' by Sirkka Heinonen and Minna Halonen Somed Foresight Report 2. Research report VTT-R-04539-07. http://owela.vtt.fi/owela/uploads/2007/11/making-sense-of-social-media-vtt-r-04539-07.pdf. The concept of CFS is offered as one way of responding to the growing demand for innovation in corporations and work organisations. The FW method was tested at VTT Technical Research Centre (http://www.vtt.fi/) in Finland in two pilots in 2006--2007. A survey was conducted to gather employee's opinions of the FW experiments. The results show that employees considered the FW positively and they confirmed that it stimulated futures thinking. The results of this study are encouraging for further developing the Futures Window as a key element of CFS. This article will present the concept of Creative Foresight Spaces in detail together with its possible applications.},

	Abstract = {The herbs of the ``mint'' group traded in the herbal market of Thessaloniki include eight taxa, members of two genera, Acinos (two species) and Mentha (four species and two hybrids). The essential oil content of 72 samples examined ranged from traces up to 1.69ml/100g of dry weight. Besides three almost scentless samples, the different ``mints'' are distinguished according to their prominent smell differences, i.e. samples with a pungent, musty and sweet type of smell. As a result, the commercial names attributed to them correspond to a particular type of smell and not to a particular taxon. A number of 29 medicinal uses were recorded in total. In most cases uses were not associated with particular taxa but were rather determined by plant smells. A literature survey has shown that the ``mints'' traded in Thessaloniki are also used as herbal medicines all over the Mediterranean area, with 67 different therapeutic uses. Among them the 22 uses, already mentioned by Dioscurides, show that the utilization of ``mints'' as herbal medicines in the Mediterranean countries has a long tradition.},

	Abstract = {The expression of the smell concentration judgment value is significantly important in the application of the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA). The original FOA can only solve problems that have optimal solutions in zero vicinity. To make FOA more universal for the continuous optimization problems, especially for those problems with optimal solutions that are not zero. This paper proposes an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm based on differential evolution (DFOA) by modifying the expression of the smell concentration judgment value and by introducing a differential vector to replace the stochastic search. Through numerical experiments based on 12 benchmark instances, experimental results show that the improved DFOA has a stronger global search ability, faster convergence, and convergence stability in high-dimensional functions than the original FOA and evolutionary algorithms from literature. The DFOA is also applied to optimize the operation of the Texaco gasification process by maximizing the syngas yield using two decision variables, i.e., oxygen--coal ratio and coal concentration. The results show that DFOA can quickly get the optimal output, demonstrating the effectiveness of DFOA.},

Even though chemical methods are available, but they are expensive, time-consuming and offline. A study has been made on real time smell monitoring of black tea during fermentation process using electronic nose and is reported in this paper.

	Abstract = {Developers continuously maintain software systems to adapt to new requirements and to fix bugs. Due to the complexity of maintenance tasks and the time-to-market, developers make poor implementation choices, also known as code smells. Studies indicate that code smells hinder comprehensibility, and possibly increase change- and fault-proneness. Therefore, they must be identified to enable the application of corrections. The challenge is that the inaccurate definitions of code smells make developers disagree whether a piece of code is a smell or not, consequently, making difficult creation of a universal detection solution able to recognize smells in different software projects. Several works have been proposed to identify code smells but they still report inaccurate results and use techniques that do not present to developers a comprehensive explanation how these results have been obtained. In this experimental report we study the effectiveness of the Decision Tree algorithm to recognize code smells. For this, it was applied in a dataset containing 4 open source projects and the results were compared with the manual oracle, with existing detection approaches and with other machine learning algorithms. The results showed that the approach was able to effectively learn rules for the detection of the code smells studied. The results were even better when genetic algorithms are used to pre-select the metrics to use.},

	Abstract = {If the illicit tobacco trade were eliminated, governments could gain at least $31.3 billion a year, and more than 164,000 premature deaths a year could be avoided after 2030 (Joossens, Merriman, Ross, and Raw, 2009). Dogs have been used successfully in tobacco control programs, and there is a good chance that rats could also play an important role. In the present experiment, giant African pouched rats were trained to respond to filters that had been stored together with cigarettes (i.e., soaked) and to not respond to filters that had been soaked with noncigarette items. Generalization to untrained types of tobacco was then tested. The sensitivity of 4 rats trained on filters soaked with 1 of 7 types of cigarettes ranged from 86% to 100% (mean, 95%). There was very little evidence of generalization when the rats were tested on tobacco leaves and snuff but good evidence of generalization when the rats were tested on cigarettes that had been soaked with strong-smelling additives. These findings suggest that rats may be a valuable asset in the global effort to control illicit cigarette trade.},

	Abstract = {Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes microbial challenge tests were performed on fresh suckling-lamb meat. Hind leg slices were chilly stored under two modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) environments (A: 15%O2/60%CO2/25%N2, B: 15%O2/30%CO2/55%N2) and vacuum packaging (V). Only E. coli was reduced between 0.72--1.25logcfu/g from day 1 to day 4 by the combined use of MAP/V, chilling storage and the growth of native lactic acid bacteria. However, L. monocytogenes was not inhibited by the application of V or MAP. Even do, in inoculated samples, this pathogen increased between 1.2--2.7logcfu/g throughout the study. Consequently, a second experiment that combined the effects of MAP/V and a protective culture (Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides PCK 18) against L. monocytogenes was designed. Two different levels of protective cultures were assayed (4 and 6logcfu/g). Lc. pseudomesenteroides PCK 18 was able to control the growth of L. monocytogenes when the differences between them are higher than 2logcfu/g. Moreover, when high level of protective culture was used a significant reduction of L. monocytogenes counts were noticed in samples packaged in 60% of CO2 along the storage period, although sensory properties were also affected.},

	Abstract = {Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) intensively rely on event-driven programming: widgets send GUI events, which capture users' interactions, to dedicated objects called controllers. Controllers implement several GUI listeners that handle these events to produce GUI commands. In this work, we conducted an empirical study on 13 large Java Swing open-source software systems. We study to what extent the number of GUI commands that a GUI listener can produce has an impact on the change- and fault-proneness of the GUI listener code. We identify a new type of design smell, called Blob listener that characterizes GUI listeners that can produce more than two GUI commands. We show that 21% of the analyzed GUI controllers are Blob listeners. We propose a systematic static code analysis procedure that searches for Blob listener that we implement in InspectorGuidget. We conducted experiments on six software systems for which we manually identified 37 instances of Blob listener. InspectorGuidget successfully detected 36 Blob listeners out of 37. The results exhibit a precision of 97.37% and a recall of 97.59%. Finally, we propose coding practices to avoid the use of Blob listeners.},

@article{VANHAGEN2014264,
	Abstract = {If Transport Operating Companies (TOCs) wish to have a right to exist in the future, then they must not only offer a trustworthy and accessible service but also ensure that the service is perceived as appealing. The train journey must be an experience, not just a trip from A to B. To purposely upgrade the service provision to a higher perception of quality (see ETC paper Van Hagen & De Bruyn, 2012) an instrument is required that specifically addresses this experience. After all, it is pointless to have a vision and to outline policy if the effects thereof can neither be measured nor influenced. This calls for an instrument which measures both the dissatisfaction (the basic service provision) and the satisfaction (extras that make the journey more pleasant). The current customer satisfaction measurements, such as KTO (KlantTevredenheidsOnderzoek) in the Netherlands or NPS (National Passenger Survey) in the UK, focus primarily on the dissatisfiers. These measurements fail to meet any necessity to regulate or influence the satisfiers, such as comfort and experiential aspects. Following the successfully implemented Station Experience Monitor (SEM, see ETC paper of Van Hagen & Heiligers, 2011), NS has now developed a Train Experience Monitor (TEM). The TEM measures those quality experiences of customers which can be monitored with an aim to influencing the main themes and underlying aspects. The TEM is a scientifically underpinned questionnaire which can ask passengers about all kinds of aspects of the train and the train journey. On the one hand these concern functional questions (aimed at dissatisfiers), such as safety, cleanliness and information provision, and on the other hand more emotional questions (aimed at satisfiers) regarding the atmosphere and comfort on the train, i.e. whether passengers find the train atmospherically pleasing, colourful, quiet and sweet-smelling. The ultimate aim of the Train Experience Monitor is to make train journeys more pleasant, thus improving the image of the TOCs and increasing the number of journeys undertaken. The TEM questionnaire was filled in by passengers on each of the nine different types of carrier running in the Netherlands and on the international high speed train to Germany, the ICE. Moreover, the enquiry was carried out on various routes throughout the country, both during the week and at the weekend, during peak and off-peak hours. The questionnaire was filled in by 5157 passengers and assessed items focusing on dissatisfiers and satisfiers within six themes: Scheduling, Staff, Atmosphere, Comfort, Functionality and Safety & Cleanliness, whereby the last four only refer to the train itself and the first two predominantly concern the train journey. The most important finding was that experience indeed plays a crucial role -- as can be seen in the appraisal of the different types of trains. The experiential aspects significantly influence the appraisal of the train and train journey. Furthermore, it appeared that a higher quality of experiential aspects results in higher appraisals of train and train journey. The differences between types of train with regard to the appraisals per theme are particularly poignant with the theme Atmosphere: the difference between new and old trains is almost one whole mark. What is striking here is that also the theme Safety & Cleanliness show a considerable difference. The measurement results of the TEM demonstrate that the train experience is a significant part of the appraisal of a train service and that this can be measured reliably thus enabling the actual regulation of experience.},

This study stems from the basic question how other senses except vision affect spatial cognition. To this end, we focused on perception of visually impaired people. We pursued empirical research based on field studies and interviews to observe the way that the visually impaired use tactile map. From this process we could find key elements of spatial information that represent space for the blind. We analyzed tactile perception of the visually impaired into five different types and developed tactile map test model. In this paper, we illustrated five types of tactile maps based on the haptic representation. For the future study, we will challenge for improvement of current tactile map and fundamental tactile information of space. In a long term goal, this research aims to develop assistive technology not just for the people who visually impaired but for enriching our senses in space.},

@article{BURNE2010268,
	Abstract = {Mice can learn a food preference from odor cues transmitted on the breath of a conspecific, even if the ``demonstrator'' is anesthetized. To our knowledge there are no studies examining the effect of anesthetizing the ``observer'' on development of memory for socially transmitted food preferences (STFP). In Experiment 1 we found that 2--4month-old F2 C57Bl/6x129sv male and female mice demonstrated a STFP after a 5min exposure to an anesthetized demonstrator mouse when tested 24h later. In Experiment 2, observer mice anesthetized with Sagatal (60mg/kg) prior to the ``social interaction'' preferentially avoided the cued food when tested 24h later. This aversion was not due to any overt aversive effects of this dose of Sagatal because mice that ate the food and were then anesthetized, or could only smell the food for 5min while anesthetized, showed no preference or aversion. In a third experiment we found that the Sagatal-induced aversion was not a general property of anesthesia because there were varied results produced by observer mice treated with anesthetic drugs with different mechanisms of action. Vetalar (200mg/kg) and Rompun (10mg/kg) treated animals ate similar amounts of cued and non-cued food at test, indicating an absence of learning. Hypnorm (0.5ml/kg) treated animals showed a preference for the cued food whereas those treated with Hypnovel (2.5ml/kg) showed an aversion to the cued food. These results show that the food aversion observed with Sagatal is not a general property of anesthetic agents, but appears to be restricted to those acting primarily on the GABAergic system. Thus, we have shown that under certain conditions it is possible for an anesthetized observer mouse to learn a preference or aversion of a socially-linked olfactory cue.},

	Abstract = {Code smells represent symptoms of poor implementation choices. Previous studies found that these smells make source code more difficult to maintain, possibly also increasing its fault-proneness. There are several approaches that identify smells based on code analysis techniques. However, we observe that many code smells are intrinsically characterized by how code elements change over time. Thus, relying solely on structural information may not be sufficient to detect all the smells accurately. We propose an approach to detect five different code smells, namely Divergent Change, Shotgun Surgery, Parallel Inheritance, Blob, and Feature Envy, by exploiting change history information mined from versioning systems. We applied approach, coined as HIST (Historical Information for Smell deTection), to eight software projects written in Java, and wherever possible compared with existing state-of-the-art smell detectors based on source code analysis. The results indicate that HIST's precision ranges between 61% and 80%, and its recall ranges between 61% and 100%. More importantly, the results confirm that HIST is able to identify code smells that cannot be identified through approaches solely based on code analysis.},

	Abstract = {Rodents can cause extensive damage in agricultural systems. This results in considerable harvest loss as well as damage to agricultural infrastructure. To prevent this, the use of rodenticides has increased worldwide. Rodenticides not only affect rodent pest species but also harm non-target species such as predators and other small mammals. In this paper we show how the odor of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) can affect the feeding behavior of two rodent species: the common vole (Microtus arvalis, Pallas) and house mouse (Mus musculus, L.). Common voles are a major vertebrate pest species in agriculture whereas house mice are commensal pests. Both species are well-known to cause severe damage to diverse agricultural enterprises in Europe. We conducted laboratory feeding experiments initially with females because their fitness depends more on their foraging behavior than it does in males. We tested a range of volatile PSMs on voles initially and those compounds that proved effective were later tested on the house mice. Out of 13 PSMs or combinations of PSMs, nine reduced the amount of food eaten and one (bucco oil) increased feeding by voles. In house mice we identified six deterrent PSMs which reduced the food intake including bucco oil and there were two compounds that had no effect on feeding. Those metabolites that were repellent should be tested in field trials for their efficacy and may be suitable alternatives to rodenticides.},

Dampness problems reported by occupants were associated with health effects (case status), while such problems observed by inspectors were not. The air relative humidity was slightly higher, during winter time, in rooms with condensation on windowpanes. The results indicate that questionnaire surveys give valid data regarding most technical characteristics. With regard to moisture damages, occupants reports seem more relevant than inspector reports, in a study of health.},

	Abstract = {Developers may introduce anti-patterns in their software systems because of time pressure, lack of understanding, communication, and--or skills. Anti-patterns impede development and maintenance activities by making the source code more difficult to understand. Detecting anti-patterns in a whole software system may be infeasible because of the required parsing time and of the subsequent needed manual validation. Detecting anti-patterns on subsets of a system could reduce costs, effort, and resources. Researchers have proposed approaches to detect occurrences of anti-patterns but these approaches have currently some limitations: they require extensive knowledge of anti-patterns, they have limited precision and recall, and they cannot be applied on subsets of systems. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SVMDetect, a novel approach to detect anti-patterns, based on a machine learning technique---support vector machines. Indeed, through an empirical study involving three subject systems and four anti-patterns, we showed that the accuracy of SVMDetect is greater than of DETEX when detecting anti-patterns occurrences on a set of classes. Concerning, the whole system, SVMDetect is able to find more anti-patterns occurrences than DETEX.},

Because of the required knowledge, an important subset of design anomalies is difficult to detect automatically, and therefore, the code of anomaly candidates must be inspected manually to validate them. However, this task is time- and resource-consuming. We propose a visualization-based approach to detect design anomalies for cases where the detection effort already includes the validation of candidates. We introduce a general detection strategy that we apply to three types of design anomaly. These strategies are illustrated on concrete examples. Finally we evaluate our approach through a case study. It shows that performance variability against manual detection is reduced and that our semi-automatic detection has good recall for some anomaly types.},

	Abstract = {In dynamic Web applications, there often exists a type of code smells, called embedded code smells, that violate important principles in software development such as software modularity and separation of concerns, resulting in much maintenance effort. Detecting and fixing those code smells is crucial yet challenging since the code with smells is embedded and generated from the server-side code. We introduce WebScent, a tool to detect such embedded code smells. WebScent first detects the smells in the generated code, and then locates them in the server-side code using the mapping between client-side code fragments and their embedding locations in the server program, which is captured during the generation of those fragments. Our empirical evaluation on real-world Web applications shows that 34%-81% of the tested server files contain embedded code smells. We also found that the source files with more embedded code smells are likely to have more defects and scattered changes, thus potentially require more maintenance effort.},

	Abstract = {Sessile Joyweed (Alteranthera sessilis) which is commonly known as Mukunuvenna in Sri Lanka, is the most widely produced and most popular of nine leafy vegetables cultivated and sold on a commercial scale in Sri Lanka. This is primarily consumed locally, while only a small quantity is exported. However, the shelf life of Mukunuvenna is as low about 3-4 days due to leaf yellowing and wilting. Consumers prefer green and turgid leafy vegetables and thus the loss is considerably high after wilting and yellowing. Ethylene is a critical problem in leaf senescence. Minute concentrations such as 1μL/L ethylene can affect leaf yellowing significantly. Thus, an ethylene blocker, 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), which is now commonly being used in the fruit industry, can be considered as an effective solution for extending the postharvest life of A. sessilis. It is not toxic and environmentally friendly thus safe with edible produce. The present study was done, with the objective of investigating effects of 1-MCP on postharvest life and sensory qualities. Two experiments were conducted for several dosages (concentration × time) to investigate the shelf-life performances and processed A. sessilis samples were used to check sensory qualities such as taste, smell, texture and colour. Samples treated with 1-MCP showed high levels of chlorophyll, lower yellowing and higher overall quality. Postharvest life of treated samples increased by 1 full-day (25% increase) under the room temperature. 1-MCP, 5ppm for 8 hour duration showed promising results. However, the obtained results did not show a specific treatment combination as the best treatment and 1-MCP did not alter the sensory qualities of the processed product.},

Previous research shows that they contain code smells, lack documentation and tests, and have a long live span during which they are transferred multiple times among users. These transfers highlight the importance of spreadsheet comprehension. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the effect of the organization of formulas on spreadsheet comprehension. To that end, we conduct a controlled experiment with 107 spreadsheet users, divided into two groups. One group receives a model where the formulas are organized such that all related components are grouped closely together, while the other group receives a model where the components are spread far and wide across the spreadsheet. All subjects perform the same set of comprehension tasks on their spreadsheet. The results indicate that the way formulas are located relative to each other in a spreadsheet, influences the performance of the subjects in their ability to comprehend and adapt the spreadsheet. Especially for the comprehension tasks, the subjects perform better on the model where the formulas were grouped closely together. For the adaptation tasks, we found that the length of the calculation chain influences the performance of the subjects more than the location of the formulas itself.},

@article{GOTTFRIED2005287,
	Abstract = {It is widely accepted that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents the main neocortical target of primary olfactory cortex. In non-human primates, the olfactory neocortex is situated along the basal surface of the caudal frontal lobes, encompassing agranular and dysgranular OFC medially and agranular insula laterally, where this latter structure wraps onto the posterior orbital surface. Direct afferent inputs arrive from most primary olfactory areas, including piriform cortex, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex, in the absence of an obligatory thalamic relay. While such findings are almost exclusively derived from animal data, recent cytoarchitectonic studies indicate a close anatomical correspondence between non-human primate and human OFC. Given this cross-species conservation of structure, it has generally been presumed that the olfactory projection area in human OFC occupies the same posterior portions of OFC as seen in non-human primates. This review questions this assumption by providing a critical survey of the localization of primate and human olfactory neocortex. Based on a meta-analysis of human functional neuroimaging studies, the region of human OFC showing the greatest olfactory responsivity appears substantially rostral and in a different cytoarchitectural area than the orbital olfactory regions as defined in the monkey. While this anatomical discrepancy may principally arise from methodological differences across species, these results have implications for the interpretation of prior human lesion and neuroimaging studies and suggest constraints upon functional extrapolations from animal data.},

	Abstract = {Refactoring, as a software engineering discipline has emerged over recent years to become an important aspect of maintaining software. Refactoring refers to the restructuring of software according to specific mechanics and principles. In this paper, we describe an analysis of the results from a tool whose purpose was to identify and extract refactorings from seven open-source Java systems. In particular, we analyzed the mechanics of the most commonly and least commonly applied refactorings to try and account for their frequency. Results showed the most common refactorings of the fifteen coined a 'Gang of Six', to be generally those with a high in-degree and low out-degree when mapped on a dependency graph; the same refactorings also featured strongly in the remedying of bad code smells. Remarkably and surprisingly, inheritance and encapsulationbased refactorings were found to have been applied relatively infrequently - we offer explanations for why this may be the case. The paper thus identifies 'core' refactorings central to many of the changes made by developers on open-source systems. While we can not guarantee that developers consciously undertake refactoring in any sense, the empirical results demonstrate that simple renaming and moving fields/methods between classes are common components of open-source system re-engineering. From a wider software engineering perspective, knowledge of what a modification will incur in likely sub-tasks is of value to developers whether working on open-source or other forms of software.},

	Abstract = {Three hundred mixed, smallholder farms in Kariti location, Kandara Division, Maragua District, Central Kenya, were surveyed. Dairy cattle management practices, including type of animal enclosure, roofing, floor type, drainage, use of bedding, feeding of concentrates; and manure management practices, including methods of manure handling and storage prior to utilization, and the addition of urine and organic materials to manure were documented. The concentrations of C, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg, and the C:N ratio of manure--composts prepared on-farm were analysed. The P concentration of manure was higher from zero-grazing units than from improved or traditional housing, higher from housing with roofs than from that without, higher when animals were fed concentrates than when not, and higher when manure was stored in a heap or pit rather than in a deep littering system. Use of bedding in the livestock housing resulted in manure with lower mineral N concentration and higher C:N ratio. Turning manure during composting resulted in manure with a higher mineral N concentration and lower C:N ratio. Results suggest that modification of traditional livestock housing (boma) to the zero-grazing system may have beneficial effects on some aspects of manure quality. Data on manure texture, colour, smell and biological activity were collected in an attempt to relate manure nutrient concentration and C:N ratio to easily discernible characteristics of manure--composts on-farm. Significant relationships were found between manure texture and the concentrations of P and mineral N, and C:N ratio. Significant relationships were also found between manure colour and N concentration and between manure age and mineral N concentration. Thus, there is scope for the development of decision tools to predict manure--compost quality from at least some manure characteristics. Dichotomous keys were prepared to determine mean manure C:N ratio and mineral N concentration on the basis of manure age and texture.},

	Abstract = {Background
Classic teaching is that narcotic analgesia in the setting of an acute abdomen can alter physical examination findings and should therefore be withheld until after a surgeon's examination.
Methods
A telephone survey of emergency medicine physicians representing 60 US hospitals was conducted to assess the current practices and opinions regarding the early administration of narcotic analgesia in this setting. Relevant literature was also reviewed for methodological errors.
Results
Fifty-nine of 60 (98.3%) respondents reported that it is their practice to administer analgesia prior to surgical evaluation. Of these, only 9 of 59 (15.3%) reported always informing the surgeon prior to dosing the patient. The two most common motivations cited were that patient discomfort takes precedence (52 of 59; 88.1%) and that the literature supports the practice to be safe (51 of 59; 86.4%).
Conclusions
It is common for emergency medicine physicians to medicate acute abdomen patients prior to surgical evaluation. Numerous significant study limitations and design flaws were found that question the validity of the four clinical trials supporting this practice. Because many physicians base their clinical decisions on these trials, a careful analysis of their shortcomings, as well as our own personal experiences and practice recommendations, is discussed.},

	Abstract = {A one-year field study analysing lungworm seropositivity by use of the MSP-ELISA was performed (1) to investigate the antibody dynamics in individual milk samples following field (re-)infections of dairy cows with the bovine lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus, (2) to investigate the correlation between individual and bulk tank milk (BTM) antibody titres and (3) to review the current individual as well as BTM cut-off value, which was extrapolated from dilution experiments (Fiedor et al., 2009). Over a one-year period individual and BTM samples were collected monthly on 15 dairy farms. Following a critical review of previous cut-off values, individual and BTM samples were subjected to different cut-off thresholds. Following Receiver-Operating-Characteristics (ROC) analysis, individual milk samples were assessed with the cut-off value 0.573, previously shown to be associated with each 100% sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the present study enabled BTM cut-off adjustment based on field data. To ensure reliable detection of herds with an in-herd prevalence of ≥20% the BTM cut-off was lowered from 0.493 to 0.410, corresponding to 100% sensitivity and 97.32% specificity. Regression analysis showed that the percentage of seropositive animals related to the corresponding BTM ODR correlated moderately (r=0.581, P<0.001), whereas a strong correlation (r=0.764, P<0.001) was found between mean individual and BTM ODR per herd and sampling month. Seasonal antibody pattern became obvious in a single-peaked antibody curve in late summer/early autumn for individual milk whilst BTM showed a two-peaked distribution with an additional spring peak besides the late summer/early autumn peak. This leads to the conclusion that the BTM-ELISA could be a useful tool to detect and control pasture contamination in the spring, following sexual maturation of hypobiotic lungworm larvae harboured by clinically asymptomatic carrier animals. In addition to the knowledge gained on antibody patterns in dairy herds and the relationship of individual and BTM, the present study enabled sensitivity and specificity calculations for the obsolete BTM cut-off value 0.493 to be performed.},

	Abstract = {JavaScript is a powerful scripting programming language that has gained a lot of attention this past decade. Initially used exclusively for client-side web development, it has evolved to become one of the most popular programming languages, with developers now using it for both client-side and server-side application development. Similar to applications written in other programming languages, JavaScript applications contain code smells, which are poor design choices that can negatively impact the quality of an application. In this paper, we investigate code smells in JavaScript server-side applications with the aim to understand how they impact the fault-proneness of applications. We detect 12 types of code smells in 537 releases of five popular JavaScript applications (i.e., express, grunt, bower, less.js, and request) and perform survival analysis, comparing the time until a fault occurrence, in files containing code smells and files without code smells. Results show that (1) on average, files without code smells have hazard rates 65% lower than files with code smells. (2) Among the studied smells, ``Variable Re-assign'' and ``Assignment In Conditional statements'' code smells have the highest hazard rates. Additionally, we conduct a survey with 1,484 JavaScript developers, to understand the perception of developers towards our studied code smells. We found that developers consider ``Nested Callbacks'', ``Variable Re-assign'' and ``Long Parameter List'' code smells to be serious design problems that hinder the maintainability and reliability of applications. This assessment is in line with the findings of our quantitative analysis. Overall, code smells affect negatively the quality of JavaScript applications and developers should consider tracking and removing them early on before the release of applications to the public.},

	Abstract = {Replicated storage for large Web services faces a trade-off between stronger forms of consistency and higher performance properties. Stronger consistency prevents anomalies, i.e., unexpected behavior visible to users, and reduces programming complexity. There is much recent work on improving the performance properties of systems with stronger consistency, yet the flip-side of this trade-off remains elusively hard to quantify. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work does so for a large, production Web service.
We use measurement and analysis of requests to Facebook's TAO system to quantify how often anomalies happen in practice, i.e., when results returned by eventually consistent TAO differ from what is allowed by stronger consistency models. For instance, our analysis shows that 0.0004% of reads to vertices would return different results in a linearizable system. This in turn gives insight into the benefits of stronger consistency; 0.0004% of reads are potential anomalies that a linearizable system would prevent. We directly study local consistency models---i.e., those we can analyze using requests to a sample of objects---and use the relationships between models to infer bounds on the others.
We also describe a practical consistency monitoring system that tracks φ-consistency, a new consistency metric ideally suited for health monitoring. In addition, we give insight into the increased programming complexity of weaker consistency by discussing bugs our monitoring uncovered, and anti-patterns we teach developers to avoid.},

With the popularity of 3D multimedia, specifically movies, television and smart phone technology, this reaffirms the desire for multimedia consumers to increase the reality and realism of the environment they are within. The introduction of olfaction could further enhance the experience of the viewer, as they are able to be engrossed within even more authentic situational conditions. Olfaction - ``Smell'', however, is notoriously considered to be distracting or annoying. In this paper, we look at the impact of olfactory media on users' performance of a task, specifically completing a word search game. Findings from the study showed that users' performance of the task was significantly better in the presence of olfaction.},

Predicting bugs in software code changes makes such identification possible. Buggy changes, changes that introduce bugs into source code, can be viewed as anomalies relative to clean changes for that they are rare and irregular. Thus, anomaly detection techniques can be applied to buggy change prediction. Isolation Forest, which detects anomalies based on the hypothesis that the anomalies have the shortest average path length on the constructed random forest, has exhibited its good performance on anomaly detection compared to other anomaly detection methods. In this paper, we adopt it in predicting bugs in software code changes. Empirical study with eight practical open source projects are conducted to validate the effective of Isolation Forest in bug prediction in software code changes. Results of the empirical study show that compared to traditional classification methods used in literature, Isolation Forest can achieve better clean precision, buggy recall, buggy F-measure, AUC and Gmean.},

	Abstract = {The ability of dogs to determine the direction of a track has been subject to little study. We conducted two experiments to examine the ability of dogs to identify the direction of human-laid trails and explore the mechanisms by which dogs determine directionality. Experiment 1 investigated the influence of canine sex and age on the ability of 22 police dogs to determine the correct direction of 10 human-laid trails. The direction in which the trail was laid on the dogs' ability to determine directionality was also explored. Eight (36.3%) dogs were consistently able to determine the correct direction of the trails. Male dogs identified the correct direction of the trails more frequently than females. Younger dogs were better at identifying the correct direction of the trails than older animals. Dogs identified the correct direction of those trails laid from left to right more frequently than those laid from right to left. Experiment 2 explored whether dogs use olfactory or visual cues to determine the correct direction of a human-laid trail. Eight dogs that were capable of following human trails in the correct direction were employed to track 10 trails that had been laid by a handler walking backwards, thereby rendering the trails devoid of accurate directional visual information. All of the dogs were consistently able to identify the correct direction of the trails. Overall, findings suggest that relatively few of the dogs in this study were accurately able to track in the correct direction, and that the dogs' ability to determine directionality was related to the animals' age and sex. Findings also suggest that the dogs employed olfactory cues to correctly elucidate direction.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an empirical study of drivers for software refactoring decisions. We studied the refactoring decisions made by 37 students evaluating ten methods of a purposefully constructed Java program. The decision rationales reported by the evaluators were coded to identify the drivers behind the decisions. The identified drivers were categorized into Structure, Documentation, Visual Representation, and General drivers. The evaluators had conflicting opinions both regarding the internal quality of the methods and refactoring decisions. Complex code problems were detected only by experienced evaluators. Using regression analysis, we looked at the predictive value of drivers explaining the refactoring decisions. The most salient driver leading to a favourable refactoring decision was method size. This study provides information of the refactoring decisions and helps form a basis for creating code problem detectors. By comparing automatic detection and the identified drivers we gained understanding of code problems that are difficult or impossible to detect automatically, for example Poor Algorithm. Issues detected only by experienced developers, and code problems for which the human eye surpasses automatic detection indicate good areas for developer education.},

	Abstract = {Increasing compliance with proper hand washing among consumers and foodservice workers during food handling and preparation is an effective strategy to minimize the spread of bacteria and disease. At home and in the food industry contributing factors and barriers exist that lead to low rates of compliance with proper hand hygiene. Recently, researchers have begun to emphasize the importance of internal motivational factors such as the emotion of disgust and how it affects hygiene behaviors. This study was designed to determine the influence of disgust and other motives on hand washing among participants when handling common foods in the foodservice industry, and if these responses are culturally dependent. A preliminary survey that showed differing levels of consumers' disgust among 21 foods commonly handled in the food industry was conducted. In the main part of the study, representatives from two cultures, Caucasian and Hispanic, were observed while they handled four common foods; apple, bread, chicken and fish. Results from this study showed that hand washing behavior was affected by the type of food being handled and the intensity of the emotion of disgust. Individuals tended to wash their hands more frequently for foods they perceived as more hazardous, and their motives to wash varied among variables of gender (self-protection for men, carryover effects for women), culture (self-protection for Caucasians, texture for Hispanics) and the type of food (self-protection for chicken, smell for fish). Additionally, as the feeling of disgust increased among individuals their probability to wash their hands also increased. Factors that did not show an influence on hand washing included the culture and gender of the participant, and whether they had past foodservice experience. These findings, in combination other studies, should be considered when designing motivation and training strategies to increase consumer or foodservice employee hand washing behaviors.},

Concretely, we conduct an empirical study by detecting Asynchrony change patterns, anti-patterns and code clones occurrences on 22 versions of four software systems and analyzing their fault-proneness. Results show that cloned files that follow the same Asynchrony change patterns have significantly increased fault-proneness with respect to other clones, and that anti-patterns following the same Asynchrony change pattern can be up to five times more risky in terms of fault-proneness as compared to other anti-patterns. Asynchrony change patterns thus seem to be strong indicators of fault-proneness for clones and anti-patterns.},

	Abstract = {Agile methods are best taught in a hands-on fashion in realistic projects. The main challenge in doing so is to assess whether students apply the methods correctly without requiring complete supervision throughout the entire project.
This paper presents experiences from a classroom project where 38 students developed a single system using a scaled version of Scrum. Surveys helped us to identify which elements of Scrum correlated most with student satisfaction or posed the biggest challenges. These insights were augmented by a team of tutors, which accompanied main meetings throughout the project to provide feedback to the teams, and captured impressions of method application in practice. Finally, we performed a post-hoc, tool-supported analysis of collaboration artifacts to detect concrete indicators for anti-patterns in Scrum adoption.
Through the combination of these techniques we were able to understand how students implemented Scrum in this course and which elements require further lecturing and tutoring in future iterations. Automated analysis of collaboration artifacts proved to be a promising addition to the development process that could potentially reduce manual efforts in future courses and allow for more concrete and targeted feedback, as well as more objective assessment.},

	Abstract = {The wastewater stream produced during tomato manufacturing is characterized by a dark color and bad smell, and is heavily polluted by organics, suspended solids and ground particles. The concentration of pollutants in the effluent can vary considerably with time and space due to the changes in the harvested fruit composition and season. A discharge in the municipal sewage system of these streams is not directly possible because of the high organic contents above the legally tolerated limits. This work deals with the treatment and purification of the wastewater stream from the tomato industry by a biological pretreatment step and a batch nanofiltration process step. For the latter, critical fluxes were measured at different recovery levels. This permits applying membrane process optimization methods based on the critical flux. The experiments show that the purification of the wastewater up to a water compatible with the municipal sewer system requirements is possible, with a recovery rate of 90%. Short-term fouling issues may be avoided at permeate fluxes about or below 8.2 l h−1 m2.},

	Abstract = {The mandarin (Citrus reticulata) peel oil consists of more than 98wt.% terpenes and a small fraction of oxygenated components responsible for its distinct smell. The terpene fraction is composed mostly of limonene and the oxygenated aroma fractions are composed mainly of linalool and decanal. The removal of terpenes must be performed in order to increase the storage time of citrus oils. In this work, the deterpenation of two different cold-pressed mandarin peel oils employing countercurrent extraction and ad-/desorption with supercritical CO2 and a combination of these processes were investigated. Countercurrent experiments were carried out at pressures ranging from 8.5 to 10.0MPa and at 50 and 60$\,^{\circ}$C. At 10.0MPa and 60$\,^{\circ}$C, a maximum selectivity of 12.8 between terpenes and aromas could be obtained at a folding ratio of 5.0, showing that the fractionation by means of countercurrent gas extraction could be employed. To investigate the complete removal of terpenes, ad-/desorption experiments were also performed and both the raffinate samples obtained through the countercurrent fractionation and the crude cold-pressed peel oils were used as feed material. The components evaluated were desorbed from silica-gel and the best fractionation results were obtained at 40$\,^{\circ}$C, 25wt.% oil loading in two sequential pressure steps. Initially, terpenes were completely desorbed at 8.0MPa. The second desorption step was carried out at 20.0MPa and a selective fractionation of important aroma components was observed. Additionally, scale-up experiments were performed.},

	Abstract = {Technical debt is a metaphor introduced by Cunningham to indicate "not quite right code which we postpone making it right". Examples of technical debt are code smells and bug hazards. Several techniques have been proposed to detect different types of technical debt. Among those, Potdar and Shihab defined heuristics to detect instances of self-admitted technical debt in code comments, and used them to perform an empirical study on five software systems to investigate the phenomenon. Still, very little is known about the diffusion and evolution of technical debt in software projects.
This paper presents a differentiated replication of the work by Potdar and Shihab. We run a study across 159 software projects to investigate the diffusion and evolution of self-admitted technical debt and its relationship with software quality. The study required the mining of over 600K commits and 2 Billion comments as well as a qualitative analysis performed via open coding.
Our main findings show that self-admitted technical debt (i) is diffused, with an average of 51 instances per system, (ii) is mostly represented by code (30%), defect, and requirement debt (20% each), (iii) increases over time due to the introduction of new instances that are not fixed by developers, and (iv) even when fixed, it survives long time (over 1,000 commits on average) in the system.},

In the first experiment, 40 participants (36 women) repeatedly consumed 20 ml of either high- (group Strong; n=20) or low-intensity (group Weak) strawberry lemonade. If flavour intensity affects SSS these two groups should differ, but both groups displayed an equal degree of SSS concerning the evaluation of taste, smell, mouth feel, appearance and prospective consumption (largest F=1.34). In Experiment 2, 60 participants (54 women) were randomly assigned to one of three groups of equal size and repeatedly exposed to 20 ml lemonade that increased (group Increase) or decreased (group Decrease) in flavour intensity, or retained a given intensity with each exposure (group Same). It was investigated whether online changes in flavour intensity interfere with the development of SSS, but again these groups displayed a similar degree of SSS to the lemonade (largest F=1.40). It is concluded that manipulation of flavour intensity does not likely affect SSS.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Despite aromatherapy's popularity, efficacy data are scant, and potential mechanisms are controversial. This randomized controlled trial examined the psychological, autonomic, endocrine, and immune consequences of one purported relaxant odor (lavender), one stimulant odor (lemon), and a no-odor control (water), before and after a stressor (cold pressor); 56 healthy men and women were exposed to each of the odors during three separate visits. To assess the effects of expectancies, participants randomized to the ``blind'' condition were given no information about the odors they would smell; ``primed'' individuals were told what odors they would smell during the session, and what changes to expect. Experimenters were blind. Self-report and unobtrusive mood measures provided robust evidence that lemon oil reliably enhances positive mood compared to water and lavender regardless of expectancies or previous use of aromatherapy. Moreover, norepinephrine levels following the cold pressor remained elevated when subjects smelled lemon, compared to water or lavender. DTH responses to Candida were larger following inhalation of water than lemon or lavender. Odors did not reliably alter IL-6 and IL-10 production, salivary cortisol, heart rate or blood pressure, skin barrier repair following tape stripping, or pain ratings following the cold pressor.},

	Abstract = {Modern programming languages, such as Java and C#, typically provide features that handle exceptions. These features separate error-handling code from regular source code and are proven to enhance the practice of software reliability, comprehension, and maintenance. Having acknowledged the advantages of exception handling features, the misuse of them can still cause catastrophic software failures, such as application crash. Prior studies suggested anti-patterns of exception handling, while little knowledge was shared about the prevalence of these anti-patterns. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence of exception-handling anti-patterns. We collected a thorough list of exception anti-patterns from 16 open-source Java and C# libraries and applications using an automated exception flow analysis tool. We found that although exception handling anti-patterns widely exist in all of our subjects, only a few anti-patterns (e.g. Unhandled Exceptions, Catch Generic, Unreachable Handler, Over-catch, and Destructive Wrapping) can be commonly identified. On the other hand, we find that the prevalence of anti-patterns illustrates differences between C# and Java. Our results call for further in-depth analyses on the exception handling practices across different languages.},

	Abstract = {There are some apparently healthy male rats that fail to mate after repeated testing with receptive females. We have previously shown that these ``non-copulator (NC)'' males show no partner preference for a receptive female when given the opportunity to physically interact with a sexually receptive female or a sexually active male. We also demonstrated that although NC males prefer odors from estrous females to odors from anestrous females, this preference is significantly reduced in comparison to the preference displayed by copulating (C) males. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in NC males sexual incentive motivation, that is, the approach behavior of male rats to either a sexually receptive female or a sexually active male in a test where the subjects can smell, hear, and see the stimulus animal but prevents their physical interaction. In addition, we determined whether NC rats have alterations in their ability to detect odors from conspecifics or odors related to food. In the detection of odors from conspecifics, we determined if these NC males are sexually attracted toward odors from receptive females or sexually active males. For food-related odors, we quantified the time it took the subjects to locate a hidden a piece of apple. Finally, using the induction of Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) as an index of neuronal activation, we compared the response of the vomeronasal projection pathway (VN pathway) of C and NC male rats exposed to estrous bedding. Males without sexual experience (WSE) were included in all experiments to determine the importance of previous heterosexual experience in the different behavioral tests and in the activity of the VN pathway. In the sexual incentive motivation test, we found that C and WSE male rats have a clear preference for estrous females over sexually active males, whereas NC male rats showed no preference. In odor tests, our results showed that C males had a clear preference for odors from estrous females as opposed to odors from sexually active males. Although NC and WSE male rats showed a preference for estrous female odors, this preference was significantly reduced compared to that shown by C males. No differences were found between WSE, C, and NC males in the detection of stimuli associated with food-related odors. A significant increase in Fos-IR was observed in the mitral cell layer of the accessory olfactory bulb in all groups when exposed to estrous bedding. However, only the C male rats exposed to estrous female bedding showed an increase Fos-IR in all structures of the VN pathway. An increase in Fos-IR was observed in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of WSE males exposed to estrous bedding. No increases in Fos-IR were detected along the VN pathway in NC male rats. We proposed that NC male rats do not display sexual behavior due to a reduced sexual motivation that could be caused by alterations in the neuronal activity of the VN pathway during the processing of estrous odors.},

Patient impressions remain an important yet often overlooked aspect of surgical success. Herein we present postoperative questionnaire results in patients after a standard direct endonasal approach, an extended suprasellar endonasal approach, and a reoperative transsphenoidal surgery for tumor removal with the operating microscope.
Methods
From July 1998 through April 2005, of 452 patients undergoing endonasal surgery, 346 were sent questionnaires, and of these, 259 (75%) completed them. Nasal packing was placed for 24 hours in the first 95 patients but not in the last 357.
Result
Overall, 73% of patients reported a better experience than expected and 8% worse than expected. A worse than expected overall experience was noted in 15% of patients with nasal packing compared with 5% of patients without packing (P = .001). Of patients with preoperative headache, 49% resolved, 34% somewhat resolved, and 5% worsened. The frequency of rhinological complaints declined from 2 weeks to 3 months postsurgery (P < .001); by 3 months or more postsurgery, 67% to 87% of patients had no rhinological complaints and 1% to 2% had severe complaints. Of 30 patients with prior sublabial surgery, the endonasal procedure afforded easier recovery (87%), less pain (80%), better nasal airflow (79%), and a shorter hospital stay (median 3 vs 5 days) (P < .001). Of 28 patients with complications, the severity of rhinological complaints was similar to those without complications except this subgroup reported greater loss of sense of smell 3 months after surgery (P < .001).
Conclusions
Rhinological recovery is typically rapid and relatively complete after direct endonasal transsphenoidal surgery using both standard and extended suprasellar approaches. Compared with the sublabial route, the endonasal approach is associated with less pain, better nasal airflow, and a shorter hospital stay.},

	Abstract = {An electronic nose is a smart instrument that is designed to detect and discriminate among complex odors by using arrays of sensors. The arrays of sensors are treated with a variety of odor-sensitive biological or chemical materials. An electronic nose is a project that uses two researches areas which are hardware for developing sensors and software using theorem from neuron network technology. The operation begins when sensors hit the smell of beer. The result is converted from analog to digital and represented in a graph form. An artificial intelligence is a tool of a thinking system which can create knowledge as if a human does. This project concerns training and testing beer by using 10 types of beer which are Asahi, Chang, Cheer, Samiguel, Singha, Kloster, Heineken, Leo, Tiger and Tai. We separate the experiment into two parts. The first part is immediate checking, which is performed immediately after the beer can is opened. The second part is to check the beer after the can is opened for 24 hours. This project consists of two data classifications which are Rule base and Neural Network. Rule base is used to classify unknown data. Neural network is used to check types of beer. Our structure in a neural network consists of 25 input nodes, 28 hidden nodes, and 10 output nodes. The percentage of correctness is equal to 87.5%.},

	Abstract = {Static analysis tools are often used by software developers to entail early detection of potential faults, vulnerabilities, code smells, or to assess the source code adherence to coding standards and guidelines. Also, their adoption within Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines has been advocated by researchers and practitioners. This paper studies the usage of static analysis tools in 20 Java open source projects hosted on GitHub and using Travis CI as continuous integration infrastructure. Specifically, we investigate (i) which tools are being used and how they are configured for the CI, (ii) what types of issues make the build fail or raise warnings, and (iii) whether, how, and after how long are broken builds and warnings resolved. Results indicate that in the analyzed projects build breakages due to static analysis tools are mainly related to adherence to coding standards, and there is also some attention to missing licenses. Build failures related to tools identifying potential bugs or vulnerabilities occur less frequently, and in some cases such tools are activated in a "softer" mode, without making the build fail. Also, the study reveals that build breakages due to static analysis tools are quickly fixed by actually solving the problem, rather than by disabling the warning, and are often properly documented.},

In this paper, we propose a novel hardware patching mechanism that can detect design errors which escaped the verification process, and can correct them directly in the field. We accomplish this goal through a simple field-programmable state matcher, which can identify erroneous configurations in the processor's control state and switch the processor into formally-verified degraded performance mode, once a "match" occurs. When the instructions exposing the design flaw are committed, the processor is switched back to normal mode. We show that our approach can detect and correct infrequently-occurring errors with almost no performance impact and has approximately 2% area overhead.},

Optimal intake of nutrients by grazing animals, however, could be more easily achieved if we were able to understand and control their dietary habits and preferences. Information on food habits of endemic sheeps in Iran is generally scarce. So one mixed flocks of sheep and goats were used in the study. The feeding behaviour of three Zandi ewes (1, 3 and 5 years old) in free grazing system was evaluated considering the plant palatability and preference value based on Close observation method (recording films by video cameras) in each month of grazing season. Then diet composition and preference index for each plant species calculated. Also Grazable Plant samples were dried and milled and analyzed by AOAC methods for qualitative factors such as: ADF%, CP%, ME, DDM%, etc. there were significant differences (p¿0.01) between different species in Nutritive value. Also, Interaction effects of species and sheep age on preference index were significant. But there were no correlation between diet composition/ preference index and forage quality. The plant preference index changed during different months too. Quite often, plants that constitute medium or small proportion of the rangeland made a large part of the grazing animal's diet. Animal experience, Month of grazing, taste, smell and plant cover were the most effective factors on sheep preference. Zandi sheep could be classified as Intermediate feeders in this rangeland.},

	Abstract = {Objective
Olfaction is important for nutrition, safety, and quality of life. Detecting smell loss in young children can be difficult, since many children with olfactory deficits do not recognize their problem and may even pretend to smell. The short attention span of some young children precludes testing with longer standardized olfactory tests. Currently there is a dearth of pediatric smell tests. In this study we evaluated the performance of 152 children and young adults on a game-like rotating ``Smell Wheel'' odor identification test. This forced-choice test, which can be self-administered, was designed to capture the child's imagination and to provide a standardized test measure with odors known to young children using a minimum number of trials.
Method
Thirty 4-5-year olds (10 female), 62 6-7-year olds (17 female), 30 10-11-year olds (18 female) and 30 18-19-year olds (15 female) were tested. Analysis of variance was used to assess the influences of sex and age on the test scores.
Results
All participants completed the simple and rapid test protocol. Test performance and age-related changes analogous to those obtained using longer tests were observed. Test scores of participants who self-administered the test were equivalent to those for whom the test was administered by the experimenter.
Conclusion
Good compliance and olfactory test findings congruent with literature results were obtained using the Smell Wheel, suggesting that this test may be useful in assessing olfactory function in pediatric settings where attentional demands are compromised and test time is limited.},

However, current research is still immature and requires considerable effort for transferring findings to practice. This work empirically investigates the impact of eliminating a set of three notorious code smells, individually as well as in all six possible sequences, on energy consumption behavior of software systems. It also analyzes whether any relationship exists between software architecture sustainability (in terms of energy efficiency) and maintainability within the context of individual and sequential code smell elimination. The study outcomes show that the selected code smell removal permutations yield variant levels of energy consumption values for the resulted refactored software versions. Also, a particular permutation is learned to yield most energy-efficient refactored software versions, when compared to all other code smell removal permutations.},

	Abstract = {We humans are the Cyrano de Bergerac's of the primate world, with conspicuously large external noses compared to other great apes. To understand why our nose evolved we must first understand the function of olfaction. To do this requires traveling back in time to the evolution of the first brain. I will describe the hypothesis that the sense of smell evolved as a sense of direction, playing a critical role in navigation and that this function explains why olfactory systems are so plastic and variable in size across animals. The navigation function of olfaction in humans has been largely neglected and I will describe studies showing that humans can orient accurately to odors in real world and virtual reality environments. But why such a nose? To understand this, I return to an evolutionary framework to describe how the first nose, a structure used both for respiration and olfaction, appeared in air-breathing fish. I describe a new hypothesis (PROUST: perceiving and representing odor utility in space and time) to explain how the evolution of air-breathing could have forced vertebrates to segregate olfactory mapping of space to the main olfactory system and the mapping of odors across time to the newly evolved second (vomeronasal) olfactory system. This dichotomy of function and the subsequent conflict between mapping time versus space using odors, could have led to a number of novel vertebrate solutions to sample odors, including the forked tongue of the snake and the human external nose. I will end by proposing that this perspective on the evolution and function of human olfaction could enhance current paradigms in human-robot communication and decision making.},

To that end a highly specific agonist, dexmedetomidine, a corresponding antagonist, atipamezole, and a less specific antagonist, yohimbine, were administered to groups of sexually inexperienced male rats. The subjects were tested in a large rectangular arena, where a sexually receptive female and an intact male were employed as incentives. The incentive animals were confined behind a wire mesh in opposite corners of the arena. The animals could see, hear and smell each other, but no sexual interaction was possible. Approach to the incentives constituted the measure of incentive motivation. In addition, the test provided data on ambulatory activity and general arousal. Dexmedetomidine, at a dose of 8μg/kg, produced a slight reduction of sexual incentive motivation. Ambulatory activity and general arousal were also inhibited. Atipamezole, in doses of 0.1 and 0.3mg/kg enhanced the positive incentive properties of the receptive female. A high dose of 1mg/kg did not have any significant effect. Ambulatory activity was slightly reduced by the two larger doses of atipamezole. Yohimbine had a slight stimulatory effect on sexual incentive motivation at a dose (4mg/kg) that also reduced ambulatory activity and general arousal. It is concluded that blockade of the adrenergic α2 receptor stimulates sexual incentive motivation in the male rat whereas stimulation of it has the opposite effect. At present it is not clear if these drug effects are caused by pre- or postsynaptic actions of the drugs, and the importance of secondary changes in other neurotransmitter systems remains unknown.},

	Abstract = {Pheromones elicit a species-wide, class-specific and stereotyped reaction. By learning class- or individual-specific cues in association with pheromones and subsequently using the cues alone for discrimination, a receiver may react more effectively to its social environment than if its only reaction to pheromones was stereotyped. In the rove beetle Aleochara curtula, recently mated females are inappropriate mating partners; nevertheless they elicit male sexual reactions owing to olfactory excitation by the female sex pheromone. During physical contact, mated females can be discerned by gustatory perception of an antiaphrodisiac pheromone via the clasper-like parameres of the male genitalia. Males transfer the antiaphrodisiac pheromone during copulation, together with the spermatophore, onto their mate. Our experiments showed that in association with antiaphrodisiac pheromone perception, males learned the scent of a mated female and relied on this chemical signature to refrain from sexual grasping responses in subsequent encounters. Habituation--dishabituation experiments further showed that the learned patterns were individual specific. The application of cuticular extracts to alter the scent of females, and the resulting inability of males to discriminate between similar-smelling females, demonstrated that males relied on cuticular hydrocarbons for individual discrimination. Chemical analysis of the cuticular profiles revealed higher variation in female than in male patterns. Learning the scent of mated females in association with the antiaphrodisiac pheromone allows males to reduce the time and energy spent on sexual reactions towards inappropriate mating partners and hence gives them more time to search for a receptive female at the mating site.},

	Abstract = {In previous work, code smells have been adapted to be applicable on spreadsheet formulas. The smell detection algorithm used in this earlier study was validated on a small dataset of industrial spreadsheets by interviewing the users of these spreadsheets and asking them about their opinion about the found smells. In this paper a more in depth validation of the algorithm is done by analyzing a set of spreadsheets of which users indicated whether or not they are smelly. This new dataset gives us the unique possibility to get more insight in how we can distinguish `bad' spreadsheets from `good' spreadsheets. We do that in two ways: For both the smelly and non smelly spreadsheets we 1) have calculated the metrics that detect the smells and 2) have calculated metrics with respect to size, level of coupling, and the use of functions. The results show that indeed the metrics for the smells decrease in spreadsheets that are not smelly. With respect to size we found to our surprise that the improved spreadsheets were not smaller, but bigger. With regard to coupling and the use of functions both datasets are similar. It indicates that it is difficult to use metrics with respect to size, degree of coupling or use of functions to draw conclusions on the complexity of a spreadsheet.},

Unfortunately, the information is not always documented. That creates long learning curve, and importantly, leads to subtle problems due to the misuse of objects.
In this paper, we propose GrouMiner, a novel graph-based approach for mining the usage patterns of one or multiple objects. GrouMiner approach includes a graph-based representation for multiple object usages, a pattern mining algorithm, and an anomaly detection technique that are efficient, accurate, and resilient to software changes. Our experiments on several real-world programs show that our prototype is able to find useful usage patterns with multiple objects and control structures, and to translate them into user-friendly code skeletons to assist developers in programming. It could also detect the usage anomalies that caused yet undiscovered defects and code smells in those programs.},

	Abstract = {Developing software with high code quality in a university environment is a challenge for instructors of software engineering capstone courses. Teaching students how to achieve quality and how to conduct code reviews in projects is often neglected, although it helps to improve maintainability.
In this paper we describe an informal review technique: branch based code reviews. Developers realize requirements in feature branches. Before they integrate source code into the main codebase, the code is reviewed asynchronously over the Internet in a quality gate to identify defects, design flaws and code flaws. Traditionally reviewing has been a task of the instructor. In our course, we delegate it to students of the development team. Our hypothesis is that students learn and adapt best practices from each other, improving code quality and their coding skills.
We applied this technique in a workflow during a project-based capstone course over the period of three semesters. 300 students conducted 2939 code reviews with 4665 comments in 33 projects with industry customers. We evaluated the workflow in a qualitative study using interviews. Our key findings are that students do not longer see reviews as a bureaucratic burden and improve their skills through the comments of experienced team members. They are convinced that reviewing code leads to higher code quality and 89 % want to use the workflow again in future projects.},

	Abstract = {Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) in commercial buildings, such as retail stores, can affect employee satisfaction, productivity, and health. This study administered an IEQ survey to retail employees and found correlations between measured IEQ parameters and the survey responses. The survey included 611 employees in 14 retail stores located in Pennsylvania (climate zone 5A) and Texas (climate zone 2A). The survey questionnaire featured ratings of different aspects of IEQ, including thermal comfort, lighting and noise level, indoor smells, overall cleanness, and environmental quality. Simultaneously with the survey, on-site physical measurements were taken to collect data of relative humidity levels, air exchange rates, dry bulb temperatures, and contaminant concentrations. This data was analyzed using multinomial logit regression with independent variables being the measured IEQ parameters, employees' gender, and age. This study found that employee perception of stuffy smells is related to formaldehyde and PM10 concentrations. Furthermore, the survey also asked the employees to report an annual frequency of common colds as a health indicator. The regression analysis showed that the cold frequency statistically correlates with the measured air exchange rates, outdoor temperatures, and indoor PM2.5 concentrations. Overall, the air exchange rate is the most influential parameter on the employee perception of the overall environmental quality and self-reported health outcome.},

	Abstract = {Despite high significance of the sense of smell, the technique of recording and reproducing the olfactory modality was hardly investigated. The odor recorder developed by our group enables electronic recording of the odors and their reproduction at any time and at properly equipped place. The odor recording technique is expected to be useful in many fields such as virtual environments and e-commerce. To realize the future application of the odor recorder, the range of flavors to be handled by the instrument has to be significantly expanded. However, the expansion has to meet the constraint of reasonable number of odor components. One way to achieve that is using the approximation technique with significant reduction of the flavor components. The alternative way could be blending the complex mixtures of odorants treated as single components. In the present study, we focused on investigating both approaches. In the first part of experiment, we successfully recorded the typical orange flavor, approximating the smell with only 3 of 14 components. Subsequently performed human sensory tests (triangle test) confirmed similarity of reproduced flavor and the target one. In the second part of the experiment, three binary mixtures of essential oils extracted from citrus fruits were successfully recorded using the odor recorder. Results of both parts of the study allowed further expansion of the applicable range of flavors for odor recorder.},

Our group has studied odor presentation with visual and auditory information using an olfactory display [1]. In VR2007, we have demonstrated the game of cooking with scent using olfactory display. In addition, we have studied smell sensing and reproduction system simultaneously with visual information. However, the function of transmitting sensory information to remote site has not been realized.
Recently, we developed the teleolfaction system synchronized with tele-vision system using odor sensor and olfactory display. Moreover, the interactivity is included in this creative showcase. The system consists of recording system and reproduction system as is shown in Fig. 1.
In the recording system, an output pattern from an array of QCM (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) sensors with partially overlapped specificities is recognized using a neural network implemented into a PC. An odor concentration is also measured using one of sensors. Moreover, a web camera simultaneously captures vision of odor sources.
In reproduction system located away from the recording system, the olfactory display emits the smell synchronized with movie on the computer screen after the data from the recording system are received via the Internet.
A user at remote site can control the position of the sensing nozzle using mobile stage via the Internet. The web camera mounted on that stage captures the image around the sensing nozzle. The user can perceive sensation interactively when he/she controls the position of the mobile stage.
An example of the sensor response to orange flavor during the stage movement is shown in Fig. 2. When the sensing nozzle is located just above the odor source, the response has the peak and the user sniffs the strongest smell at the remote site.},

	Abstract = {Recently, olfactory training has been introduced as a promising treatment for patients with olfactory dysfunction. However, less is known about the neuronal basis and the influence on functional networks of this training. Thus, we aimed to investigate the neuroplasticity of chemosensory perception through an olfactory training program in patients with smell loss. The experimental setup included functional MRI (fMRI) experiments with three different types of chemosensory stimuli. Ten anosmic patients (7f, 3m) and 14 healthy controls (7f, 7m) underwent the same testing sessions. After a 12-week olfactory training period, seven patients (4f, 3m) were invited for follow-up testing using the same fMRI protocol. Functional networks were identified using independent component analysis and were further examined in detail using functional connectivity analysis. We found that anosmic patients and healthy controls initially use the same three networks to process chemosensory input: the olfactory; the somatosensory; and the integrative network. Those networks did not differ between the two groups in their spatial extent, but in their functional connectivity. After the olfactory training, the sensitivity to detect odors significantly increased in the anosmic group, which was also manifested in modifications of functional connections in all three investigated networks. The results of this study indicate that an olfactory training program can reorganize functional networks, although, initially, no differences in the spatial distribution of neural activation were observed.},

	Abstract = {The regular expression (regex) is a powerful tool employed in a large variety of software engineering tasks. However, prior work has shown that regexes can be very complex and that it could be difficult for developers to compose and understand them. This work seeks to identify code smells that impact comprehension. We conduct an empirical study on 42 of pairs of behaviorally equivalent but syntactically different regexes using 180 participants and evaluated the understandability of various regex language features. We further analyzed regexes in GitHub to find the community standards or the common usages of various features. We found that some regex expression representations are more understandable than others. For example, using a range (e.g., [0-9]) is often more understandable than a default character class (e.g., [d]). We also found that the DFA size of a regex significantly affects comprehension for the regexes studied. The larger the DFA of a regex (up to size eight), the more understandable it was. Finally, we identify smelly and non-smelly regex representations based on a combination of community standards and understandability metrics.},

	Abstract = {The object-oriented approach has been the most popular software design methodology for the past twenty-five years. Several design patterns and principles are defined to improve the design quality of object-oriented software systems. In addition, designers can use unique design motifs that are designed for the specific application domains. Another commonly used technique is cloning and modifying some parts of the software while creating new modules. Therefore, object-oriented programs can include many identical design structures. This work proposes a sub-graph mining-based approach for detecting identical design structures in object-oriented systems. By identifying and analyzing these structures, we can obtain useful information about the design, such as commonly-used design patterns, most frequent design defects, domain-specific patterns, and reused design clones, which could help developers to improve their knowledge about the software architecture. Furthermore, problematic parts of frequent identical design structures are appropriate refactoring opportunities because they affect multiple areas of the architecture. Experiments with several open-source and industrial projects show that we can successfully find many identical design structures within a project (intra-project) and between different projects (inter-project). We observe that usually most of the detected identical structures are an implementation of common design patterns; however, we also detect various anti-patterns, domain-specific patterns, reused design parts and design-level clones.},

	Abstract = {Refactoring is a well-known technique that preserves software behaviors and improves its bad structures or bad smells. In most cases, more than one bad smell is found in a program. Consequently, developers frequently apply refactorings more than once. Applying appropriate refactoring sequences, an ordered list of refactorings, developers can remove bad smells as well as reduce improvement time and produce highly maintainable software. According to our 2011 survey, developers consider four main criteria to select an optimal refactoring sequence: 1) the number of removed bad smells, 2) maintainability, 3) the size of refactoring sequence and 4) the number of modified program elements. A refactoring sequence that satisfies these four criteria produces code without bad smells, with higher maintainability, using the least improvement effort and time, and providing more traceability. Some existing works suggest a list of refactorings without ordering, and others suggest refactoring sequences. However, these works do not consider the four criteria discussed earlier. Therefore, our research proposes an approach to identify an optimal refactoring sequence that meets these criteria. In addition, it is expected that the findings will reduce maintenance time and cost, increase maintainability and enhance software quality.},

	Abstract = {Military barracks throughout Taiwan produce large quantities of organic wastes from gardening, such as leaves, grass and flowers. By manipulating and observing the related parameters of the windrow composting process, the study seeks to find an optimum treatment method for plant wastes. Mature compost was used in small amounts as a fermenting source for each experimental sample. Results show that unpleasant smells that other composting methods produce is significantly decreased with effective control of relationships between temperature, saturation and turnover frequency. Furthermore, the time required to complete composting is shortened to 2--3 months. The fertility of the products depends on the original compost materials and the composting method. Through windrow composting, composted matter can reach a fertility level between that of soil and manure. Additionally, this process greatly reduces waste management costs because it utilizes the barrack's undeveloped area. Experiments in the barracks show that advantages of windrow composting include low facility investment, high environmental-friendliness, easy operation and low failure rate. Thus, it is particularly suitable for military barracks, institutions or schools with large open areas, highly green environments and plenty of labor.},

In line with our predictions, two experiments show that smell can impact touch in meaningful ways. Specifically, we show that multisensory semantic congruence between smell and touch properties of a stimulus enhances haptic perception and product evaluation. We explore this relationship in the context of two properties of touch, namely texture and temperature, and demonstrate that both smell and touch can have semantic associations, which can affect haptic perception and product evaluation depending on whether they match or not. In study 1, we focus on the semantic association of smell and touch (texture) with gender and in study 2 with temperature. Our results extend prior work on smell and touch within consumer behavior, and further contribute to emerging literature on multisensory interactions.},

	Abstract = {The importance of eating away from home has revealed the need to understand consumer perception with respect to the physical risks in this context. When a consumer perceives risks, he/she uses different strategies to minimize them. This study aimed to identify consumer perception concerning the physical risks of consuming raw vegetable salads in full-service restaurants, as also the frequency of using physical risk-reducing strategies, examining the influence of socio-demographic variables and social desirability. The survey instrument consisted of 5 items to measure risk perception, 17 items regarding the risk-reducing strategies, socio-demographic questions and the social desirability scale. A total of 359 consumers were interviewed in the city of Campinas, Brazil. An exploratory factor analysis was carried out to group the risk-reducing strategies using the software PASW Statistics, 18.0. A moderate level of physical risk (mean$\pm$standard deviation=24.2$\pm$13.2, on a response scale that could vary between 1 and 49) was perceived by consumers. Three physical risk-reducing strategies presented significant positive correlation (p<0.05) with social desirability, and were excluded from the other statistical analyses. The fourteen physical risk-reducing strategies were categorized in four factors: ``restaurant quality and previous bad experience'', ``information from the waiter, the media, and the price'', ``workers and restaurant smell'' and ``word of mouth and full, already known restaurant''. ``Restaurant quality and previous bad experience'' was the factor significantly (p<0.05) more used by the consumers in the reduction of physical risks, whereas ``information from the waiter, the media, and the price'' was the least used. Differences (p<0.05) in the frequencies of using the strategies contained in the factors were identified with respect to the socio-demographic variables. Those individuals who perceived a greater level of physical risk in the context surveyed used all the factors related to the strategies with greater frequency, to reduce the risk. The results could provide important information for public and private programs.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we offer an efficient real-time video abstraction technique that enables interaction with the real-world environment using a smart device for combining augmented reality (AR) and virtual content. The conventional video abstraction technique is inappropriate for the real-time processing of AR content. Therefore, real-time video abstraction through the GPU approach is necessary to minimize the CPU processing of AR content. The methods other than the abstraction technique using the Open GL-ES shader have constraints regarding hardware and the dependency of AR content data. Consequently, this paper proposes a real-time video abstraction technique using the Open GL-ES shader. The proposed real-time video abstraction technique is a method for minimizing the disharmony between virtual and real-world content occurring on AR performing in the limited computing resources of a smart device. To do this, we performed research on video abstraction and applied three filtering algorithms (Sobel operator, Striped pattern-based toon, Non-boundary-based color quantization). In addition, we considered the applicability of AR content through real-time video abstraction experiments using adjusted and monitoring parameters.},

Pine weevils are attracted by the smell of fresh stumps in clear-cut areas, and have been shown to cause serious damage to planted coniferous seedlings in European forests. This study was conducted to measure the incidence of pine weevil and damage caused to Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings in a field experiment including single stump pile plots (SSP), multiple stump pile plots (MSP) and control plots in North Karelia, Finland. Pine weevils were significantly more abundant in MSP stump plots (22% higher) than in SSP plots, and are 23% more abundant compared to the control plots. The extent of seedling damage was significantly lower in the SSP (by 67%) and MSP plots (by 58%) than in the controls. Seedlings damage increased significantly with the distance from the stump pile. Stump harvesting practices should be updated and, in particular, multiple stump piles should be avoided in the clearcut area. However, future studies will be required to explore the environmental and physical factors in the stump-removal area influencing pine weevil abundance.},

	Abstract = {Background: Code smells are indicators of quality problems that make a software hard to maintain and evolve. Given the importance of smells in the source code's maintainability, many studies have explored the characteristics of smells and analyzed their effects on the software's quality. Aim: We aim to investigate fundamental characteristics of code smells through an empirical study on frequently occurring smells that examines inter-category and intra-category correlation between design and implementation smells. Method: The study mines 19 design smells and 11 implementation smells in 1988 C# repositories containing more than 49 million lines of code. The mined data are statistically analyzed using methods such as Spearman's correlation and presented through hexbin and scatter plots. Results: We find that unutilized abstraction and magic number smells are the most frequently occurring smells in C# code. Our results also show that implementation and design smells exhibit strong inter-category correlation. The results of co-occurrence analysis imply that whenever unutilized abstraction or magic number smells are found, it is very likely to find other smells from the same smell category in the project. Conclusions: Our experiment shows high average smell density (14.7 and 55.8 for design and implementation smells respectively) for open source C# programs. Such high smell densities turn a software system into a house of cards reflecting the fragility introduced in the system. Our study advocates greater awareness of smells and the adoption of regular refactoring within the developer community to avoid turning software into a house of cards.},

	Abstract = {In some mating systems males should benefit from mating with virgin females because of their higher reproductive value. We determined experimentally whether and how males distinguish between virgin and recently mated females in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a promiscuous livebearer. In a free-swimming experiment, males showed flexible mating behaviour by adjusting their tactics according to the mating status of the female they encountered, virgin or mated. Males followed, nipped and copulated with virgins more than with mated females, but they performed more sneaky copulations with mated females, possibly because the latter were more reluctant to mate than virgin females. When, in another set of experiments, males received only the visual cues of both virgins and mated females they showed no preference for either, but when they were exposed only to the female olfactory cues, they associated considerably more with the smell of virgin females. These results suggest that male guppies assess female behavioural and olfactory cues to determine female virginity and then use different mating tactics depending on the female's status. It is possible that the changes in male mating behaviour increase male reproductive success.},

Our proposed techniques enable an order of magnitude reduction in the number of queries and time needed to learn a botnet C &C protocol compared to classic algorithms (from days to hours for inferring the MegaD C &C protocol). We also show that the computed protocol state machines enable formal analysis for botnet defense, including finding the weakest links in a protocol, uncovering protocol design flaws, inferring the existence of unobservable communication back-channels among botnet servers, and finding deviations of protocol implementations which can be used for fingerprinting. We validate our technique by inferring the protocol state-machine from Postfix's SMTP implementation and comparing the inferred state-machine to the SMTP standard. Further, our experimental results offer new insights into MegaD's C &C, showing our technique can be used as a powerful tool for defense against botnets.},

	Abstract = {Reduced sulphur compounds (RSCs) emitted from pig farms are a major problem for agriculture, due to their health and environmental impacts and foul odour. This study investigates the removal of RSCs, including H2S, and their oxidation product SO2 using Gas Phase Advanced Oxidation (GPAO). GPAO is a novel air cleaning technique which utilises accelerated atmospheric chemistry to oxidise pollutants before removing their oxidation products as particles. Removal efficiencies of 24.5% and 3.9% were found for 461ppb of H2S and 714ppb of SO2 in a laboratory system (volumetric flow Q=75m3/h). A numerical model of the reactor system was developed to explore the basic features of the system; its output was in fair agreement with the experiment. The model verified the role of OH radicals in initiating the oxidation chemistry. All sulphur removed from the gas phase was detected as particulate matter, assuming the observed particles were made of sulphuric acid. In a second set of experiments a range of RSCs at mixing ratios typically found in pig farms were treated using a larger industry-scale system (Q=600--1200m3/h) that included a wet scrubber. Removal efficiencies >90% were found for all compounds. The study demonstrates the ability of GPAO to control RSC emissions with a low energy input relative to many currently available techniques.},

	Abstract = {Black tea quality is a very complex phenomenon. There are almost two hundred varieties of bio-chemical compounds, both volatile and nonvolatile present in tea and each of these compounds contribute to tea quality (B. Banerjee, 1996), The major quality attributes of tea are flavour, aroma, colour and strength. Acceptance by consumers and price realized depend on these attributes (S.Y. Dheodhar et al.,). Out of these, aroma is the most important of the attributes and in common parlance, aroma means smell of the tea. Characterization of aroma of tea has been a challenge for tea scientists for long. Efforts have been made towards this through chemical analysis and instrumental studies through gas chromatography (GC) and high profile liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques. Research and studies have been reported with success for quality characterization of food and beverages using electronic nose (T.C. Pearce et al., 2003). This paper reports a study and results on applicability of electronic nose for aroma characterization of orthodox black tea. Six varieties of orthodox tea samples were tested using Alpha MOS 2000 Electronic Nose and data obtained from the experimental setup have been successfully classified using principal component analysis (PCA) and back-propagation multilayer perceptron model.},

	Abstract = {In this study, an electrical fire simulator was fabricated and connected to a test platform which can take high throughput screening of materials through the method of combinatorial material science. WO3 and In2O3 were used as basis materials in the experiment and modified through the way of micro-injection in order to find the best one sensitive to electrical fire. It is found that CrCl3-modified and MgCl2-modified WO3, as well as LaOCl-modified and SmOCl-modified In2O3 show the best sensing performance. They can be used as sensitive materials for early detection of electrical fire because they have good sensitivity to the smell of PVC even if the working temperature of PVC insulated wires is lower than 200$\,^{\circ}$C. Therefore, it confirms that the early detection of electrical fire in the invisible smoke stage is feasible by using the modified WO3 or In2O3.},

Anti-pattern, as an effective and objective mean to verify the correctness of process model, is gaining increasing attention. Great loss could be avoided if control-flow anti-patterns were detected in an early time. In this paper, a control-flow anti-pattern detection approach for process models is proposed, which can support user-defined control-flow anti-pattern detection with different process modeling languages. To achieve this, firstly the control-flow structure of process model is transformed to refined process structure tree (RPST for short) via the cycle equivalence algorithm. Then CAPDL, a control-flow anti-patterns description language, is designed and an anti-pattern detection algorithm based on CAPDL is proposed. Finally, an anti-pattern detection experiment was conducted based on 278 real-world BPMN process models, the detection result of which shows that the proposed approach can detect user-defined control-flow anti-patterns effectively.},

	Abstract = {Code smells are symptoms that something is wrong in the source code. They have been catalogued and investigated in several programming techniques. These techniques can be used to develop Software Product Lines (SPL). However, feature-oriented programming (FOP) is a specific technique to deal with the modularization of features in SPL. One of the most popular FOP languages is AHEAD and, as far as we are concerned, we still lack systematic studies on the categorization and detection of code smells in AHEADFOP languages-based SPL. To fill this gap, this paper extends the definitions of three traditional code smells, namely God Method, God Class, and Shotgun Surgery, to take into account FOP abstractions. We then proposed 8 new FOP measures to quantify specific characteristics of compositional approaches like AHEAD. Finally, we combine the proposed and existing measures to define 3 detection strategies for identifying the investigated code smells. To evaluate the detection strategies, we performed an exploratory study involving 26 participants. The study participants rely on metrics to identify code smells in 8 AHEAD systems. Our results show that the proposed detection strategies can be used as code smell predictor since statistical tests indicate agreement among them and the study participants.},

To succeed this project, the management at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and their contractor, Thiokol overruled engineer's opinion and commented that the data given was inconclusive. This situation went worse when the management level made irrational decisions to launch the mission yet they knew there was a design flaw in Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). Due to their irresponsible conducts, seven astronauts were killed when the space shuttle they were piloting, the Challenger, exploded 73 seconds after liftoff. It was the first tragedy in US lost their astronauts in flight. Consequently, NASA had to suspend shuttle flights for two years. In order to analyze this case study, analysis is placed on using ethical theories are the foreground. Each ethical theory emphasizes different points to examine problems from different perspectives in order to reach an ethically correct decision. Hence, knowledge of ethical theories is essential because it provides a framework for understanding and making a better decision.},

In contrast with software however, spreadsheets are rarely checked, tested or certified. In this paper, we aim at developing an approach for detecting smells that indicate weak points in a spreadsheet's design. To that end we first study code smells and transform these code smells to their spreadsheet counterparts. We then present an approach to detect the smells, and to communicate located smells to spreadsheet users with data flow diagrams. To evaluate our apporach, we analyzed occurrences of these smells in the Euses corpus. Furthermore we conducted ten case studies in an industrial setting. The results of the evaluation indicate that smells can indeed reveal weaknesses in a spreadsheet's design, and that data flow diagrams are an appropriate way to show those weaknesses.},

@article{BACCINO2010443,
	Abstract = {The way odors are verbally coded in many languages is not very efficient for successful intersubjective communication. Nevertheless, some types of verbalization seem to facilitate the sharing of an olfactory experience. The experiment reported here was aimed at gaining a better understanding of how successful oral communication in the domain of olfaction works. It was hypothesized that oral description of odors enhances the recognition of olfactory stimuli that match the description. The experimental situation involved two participants, one of whom (sender) smelled and orally described an odorant to the other person (receiver) who had to recognize it. Qualitative analyses (verbal) from the communication phase and quantitative analyses (recognition rate) from the recognition phase were made. The line of study of the participants (18 chemistry students and 18 humanities students) and the type-of-odorant used had no effect on the recognition rate. On the other hand, as the number of trials increased, a slight but still statistically significant interaction between participant sex and odor-recognition rate was observed. The qualitative analysis showed that the oral communication revolved mainly around five types of description - known source, odor intensity, hedonistic valence, odorant property, and odorant effect -- and that the use of too many of these descriptors reduces performance. Descriptions were based on associations and fuzzy categories, they were related to the body, occasionally contained references to other senses (sight, touch, and taste), and could exhibit considerable self-confidence, even on trials that ended in a recognition failure. These findings support the idea that one and the same scent-bearing substance can be subject to highly diverse cognitive processing.},

Due to this, many software fails to get repair within real time constraint. Ascribe to technology advancements and changing requirements, software must be well developed and maintained to get adapted. Hence, it is necessary to predict software maintainability in the early phases of the lifecycle so that optimization of resources can be possible and cost can be reduced. Software Maintainability is the quality attribute of software product that explains the ease with which modifications can be performed. The main focus in this study is to propose the use of Gene Expression Programming (GEP) for the software maintainability prediction and measure its performance with various machine leaning techniques such as Decision Tree Forest, Support Vector Machine, Linear regression, Multilayer Perceptron and Radial basis function neural network. The empirical study is conducted with the help of four open source datasets. Eleven bad smells are identified and is considered as maintenance effort. Results of this study show that GEP algorithm performs better than machine learning classifiers; hence it can be used as sound alternative in the prediction of software maintainability. This study would be helpful in achieving better resource allocation hence it will be useful for developers and maintainers.},

	Abstract = {Objective
Describe detailed histopathologic findings from a cohort of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and evaluate whether histologic measures correlate with baseline clinical factors.
Study Design
Cross-sectional study with planned data collection.
Setting
Tertiary medical center.
Subjects and Methods
Adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were prospectively enrolled and demographic data and medical comorbidities recorded. Disease severity was measured by computed tomography (CT), endoscopy, Smell Identification Test (SIT), the Chronic Sinusitis Survey, Rhinosinusitis Disability Index, and SF-36 General Health Survey. Mucosal specimens were assessed for the presence of mucosal inflammation, including cellular (eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, mast cells, plasma cells, macrophages), epithelial (squamous metaplasia, basement membrane thickening, goblet cells), and stromal markers (subepithelial edema, fibrosis). Histopathologic findings were correlated to baseline clinical factors.
Results
A total of 147 subjects were enrolled with histologic samples available for review. Presence of inflammatory markers was diverse, with lymphocytes present in 100 percent of subjects, eosinophils in 49.7 percent, and neutrophils found in 0.7 percent. Total eosinophil counts correlated with the presence of nasal polyposis (r = −0.367; P < 0.001), asthma (r = 0.264; P = 0.001), and aspirin intolerance (r = 0.279; P = 0.001). Mucosal eosinophilia correlated with worse disease severity on CT (r = 0.414; P < 0.001), endoscopy (r = 0.376; P < 0.001), and SIT (r = −0.253; P = 0.002), with the highest correlations seen in subgroups without nasal polyps. Histopathologic findings did not significantly correlate with any quality-of-life measure.
Conclusion
Mucosal eosinophilia correlates with objective disease severity as defined by CT, endoscopy, and SIT scores. Although other histologic markers of inflammation are present, none show similar correlations. The presence of mucosal eosinophils does not correlate with quality-of-life scores.},

	Abstract = {Managing tail latency of requests has become one of the primary challenges for large-scale Internet services. Data centers are quickly evolving and service operators frequently desire to make changes to the deployed software and production hardware configurations. Such changes demand a confident understanding of the impact on one's service, in particular its effect on tail latency (e.g., 95th-or 99th-percentile response latency of the service). Evaluating the impact on the tail is challenging because of its inherent variability. Existing tools and methodologies for measuring these effects suffer from a number of deficiencies including poor load tester design, statistically inaccurate aggregation, and improper attribution of effects. As shown in the paper, these pitfalls can often result in misleading conclusions. In this paper, we develop a methodology for statistically rigorous performance evaluation and performance factor attribution for server workloads. First, we find that careful design of the server load tester can ensure high quality performance evaluation, and empirically demonstrate the inaccuracy of load testers in previous work. Learning from the design flaws in prior work, we design and develop a modular load tester platform, Treadmill, that overcomes pitfalls of existing tools. Next, utilizing Treadmill, we construct measurement and analysis procedures that can properly attribute performance factors. We rely on statistically-sound performance evaluation and quantile regression, extending it to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of server systems. Finally, we use our augmented methodology to evaluate the impact of common server hardware features with Facebook production workloads on production hardware. We decompose the effects of these features on request tail latency and demonstrate that our evaluation methodology provides superior results, particularly in capturing complicated and counter-intuitive performance behaviors. By tuning the hardware features as suggested by the attribution, we reduce the 99th-percentile latency by 43% and its variance by 93%.

In this paper, we propose Historical Information for Smell deTection (HIST), an approach exploiting change history information to detect instances of five different code smells, namely Divergent Change, Shotgun Surgery, Parallel Inheritance, Blob, and Feature Envy. We evaluate HIST in two empirical studies. The first, conducted on 20 open source projects, aimed at assessing the accuracy of HIST in detecting instances of the code smells mentioned above. The results indicate that the precision of HIST ranges between 72 and 86 percent, and its recall ranges between 58 and 100 percent. Also, results of the first study indicate that HIST is able to identify code smells that cannot be identified by competitive approaches solely based on code analysis of a single system's snapshot. Then, we conducted a second study aimed at investigating to what extent the code smells detected by HIST (and by competitive code analysis techniques) reflect developers' perception of poor design and implementation choices. We involved 12 developers of four open source projects that recognized more than 75 percent of the code smell instances identified by HIST as actual design/implementation problems.},

	Abstract = {In software development, especially component-based software development, dependency locality states that relevant software components should be at shorter distances than irrelevant components. This principle is used together with modularity and hierarchy to guide the design of large-scale complex software systems. In previous work, dependency locality and its correlation with design quality were studied by statically measuring the interactions between software components. This paper presents an empirical approach to evaluating the hierarchical structure of software systems through mining their revision history. Two metrics, spatial distance and temporal distance, are adapted to measure the dependencies between software components. The correlation of spatial distance and temporal distance between software components represents a factor that influences system design quality. More specially, a well designed system hierarchy should have a significant positive correlation while a non-significant positive correlation or a negative correlation would signify design flaws. In an application of this approach, we use Mantel test to study the dependency locality of six software systems from Apache projects.},

	Abstract = {Code smells in a program represent indications of structural quality problems, which can be addressed by software refactoring. However, refactoring intends to achieve different goals in practice, and its application may not reduce smelly structures. Developers may neglect or end up creating new code smells through refactoring. Unfortunately, little has been reported about the beneficial and harmful effects of refactoring on code smells. This paper reports a longitudinal study intended to address this gap. We analyze how often commonly-used refactoring types affect the density of 13 types of code smells along the version histories of 23 projects. Our findings are based on the analysis of 16,566 refactorings distributed in 10 different types. Even though 79.4% of the refactorings touched smelly elements, 57% did not reduce their occurrences. Surprisingly, only 9.7% of refactorings removed smells, while 33.3% induced the introduction of new ones. More than 95% of such refactoring-induced smells were not removed in successive commits, which suggest refactorings tend to more frequently introduce long-living smells instead of eliminating existing ones. We also characterized and quantified typical refactoring-smell patterns, and observed that harmful patterns are frequent, including: (i) approximately 30% of the Move Method and Pull Up Method refactorings induced the emergence of God Class, and (ii) the Extract Superclass refactoring creates the smell Speculative Generality in 68% of the cases.},

Experiment 1 demonstrated that thinking about one's income as an hourly wage reduced the happiness that participants derived from leisure time on the internet. Experiment 2 revealed that a similar manipulation decreased participants' state of happiness after listening to a pleasant song and that this effect was fully mediated by the degree of impatience experienced during the music. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that the deleterious effect on happiness caused by impatience was attenuated by offering participants monetary compensation in exchange for time spent listening to music, suggesting that a sensation of unprofitably wasted time underlay the induced impatience. Together these experiments establish that thinking about time in terms of money can influence how people experience pleasurable events by instigating greater impatience during unpaid time.},

	Abstract = {In current, typical software development projects, hundreds of developers work asynchronously in space and time and may introduce anti-patterns in their software systems because of time pressure, lack of understanding, communication, and-or skills. Anti-patterns impede development and maintenance activities by making the source code more difficult to understand. Detecting anti-patterns incrementally and on subsets of a system could reduce costs, effort, and resources by allowing practitioners to identify and take into account occurrences of anti-patterns as they find them during their development and maintenance activities. Researchers have proposed approaches to detect occurrences of anti-patterns but these approaches have currently four limitations: (1) they require extensive knowledge of anti-patterns, (2) they have limited precision and recall, (3) they are not incremental, and (4) they cannot be applied on subsets of systems. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SMURF, a novel approach to detect anti-patterns, based on a machine learning technique - support vector machines - and taking into account practitioners' feedback. Indeed, through an empirical study involving three systems and four anti-patterns, we showed that the accuracy of SMURF is greater than that of DETEX and BDTEX when detecting anti-patterns occurrences. We also showed that SMURF can be applied in both intra-system and inter-system configurations. Finally, we reported that SMURF accuracy improves when using practitioners' feedback.},

	Abstract = {A new method for the odor recorder, electronically recording the recipe of odors or scents made up of many components, was proposed. Although apple flavors have been recorded with a mixture of five components using the odor recorder in previous work, the number of odor components should be increased to expand the applicable range of odors. Since the collinearity problem of the odor sensor array became apparent with the increase of components, a new method based on variable transformation using singular value decomposition was developed in this paper, to extract the effective subspace of the sensor outputs for recipe exploration. As a result, the sensor-array response pattern of the reproduced odor, with the eight-component recipe, almost agreed with that of the target apple flavor. Furthermore, human sensory tests revealed that the smell of the approximated odor was identical to that of the target flavor.},

This strictly limits the number of kinds of issues that can be detected. In this paper, we discuss a generic approach based on the detection of infeasible paths in code that can discover a wide range of code smells ranging from useless code that hinders comprehension to real bugs. Code issues are identified by calculating the difference between the control-flow graph that contains all technically possible edges and the corresponding graph recorded while performing a more precise analysis using abstract interpretation.

We investigated this problem from an Information Foraging perspective and we report on two empirical studies that focused on the information scent of images. Our results show that images have their own distinct "smell" which is not as strong as that of text. We also found that combining images and text cues leads to a stronger overall scent. Surprisingly, when images were added to search engine results pages, this did not lead our participants to behave significantly differently in terms of effectiveness or efficiency. Even when we added images that could confuse the participants' scent, this had no significantly detrimental impact on their behaviour. However, participants expressed a preference for results pages which included images.

	Abstract = {Code smells are considered to be indicators of design flaws or problems in source code. Various tools and techniques have been proposed for detecting code smells. The number of code smells detected by these tools is generally large, so approaches have also been developed for prioritizing and filtering code smells. However, the lack of empirical data regarding how developers select and prioritize code smells hinders improvements to these approaches. In this study, we investigated professional developers to determine the factors they use for selecting and prioritizing code smells. We found that Task relevance and Smell severity were most commonly considered during code smell selection, while Module importance and Task relevance were employed most often for code smell prioritization. These results may facilitate further research into code smell detection, prioritization, and filtration to better focus on the actual needs of developers.},

	Abstract = {Visual notations form an integral part of the language of software engineering (SE). Yet historically, SE researchers and notation designers have ignored or undervalued issues of visual representation. In evaluating and comparing notations, details of visual syntax are rarely discussed. In designing notations, the majority of effort is spent on semantics, with graphical conventions often an afterthought. Typically no design rationale, scientific or otherwise, is provided for visual representation choices. While SE has developed mature methods for evaluating and designing semantics, it lacks equivalent methods for visual syntax. This tutorial defines a set of principles for designing cognitively effective visual notations: ones that are optimised for human communication and problem solving. Together these form a design theory, called the Physics of Notations as it focuses on the physical (perceptual) properties of notations rather than their logical (semantic) properties. The principles were synthesised from theory and empirical evidence from a wide range of fields and rest on an explicit theory of how visual notations communicate. They can be used to evaluate, compare and improve existing visual notations as well as to construct new ones. The tutorial identifies serious design flaws in some of the leading SE notations together with practical suggestions for improving them. It also showcases some examples of visual notation design excellence from SE and other fields.},

In particular, artificial intelligent technologies based on big data enable to understand natural language, enhance day to day human experience, and make a better decision. In this paper, we propose a method to classify unstructured text data on the Web into the five types of sensation features: sight (ophthalmoception), hearing (audioception), touch (tactioception), smell (olfacception), and taste (gustaoception). Even though sensation is the first process of human experience against the environments, the study of sensation information extraction is neglected due to lack of sensory expression and knowledge comparing with the sentimental analysis or opinion mining. We first define the sensation measurement that is assigned to each feature. Then, we identify which sensation feature has a strong influence on human perceptual experience in a specific topic of corpus. Finally, we evaluate our method by comparing with several baselines in terms of the accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Context
As the European population ages and the number of cancer deaths annually increases, there is an urgent requirement to provide high-quality, effective care. The measurement of outcomes in advanced disease is complex, and to conduct comparative research and meta-analyses, appropriate tool selection is essential.
Objectives
This study aimed to identify the outcome tools currently in use in end-of-life care (both clinically and for research) across Europe and investigate the preferred features of outcome tools from the perspective of those who select and apply them.
Methods
A pan-European Internet-based survey of tool users was conducted in research and clinical populations. Respondents were asked to identify the tools they are using and describe ideal features of the measures. The study was conducted in accordance with guidance for best practice in web-based research.
Results
Of the 311 participants who completed a survey, 99 tools in clinical care and audit, and 94 in research, were cited by less than 10 participants. Further data revealed that respondents require the number of potential tools to be rationalized and that brief tools are favored.
Conclusion
The selection of valid and appropriate tools for palliative care populations requires expert guidance and support to ensure that clinicians and researchers are collecting data that have validity and potential for comparison within and between populations and countries.},

	Abstract = {Interference with cholinergic functions in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex impairs learning and memory for social transmission of food preference, suggesting that acetylcholine (ACh) release in the two brain regions may be important for acquiring the food preference. This experiment examined release of ACh in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of rats during training for social transmission of food preference. After demonstrator rats ate a food with novel flavor and odor, a social transmission of food preference group of rats was allowed to interact with the demonstrators for 30min, while in vivo microdialysis collected samples for later measurement of ACh release with HPLC methods. A social control group observed a demonstrator that had eaten food without novel flavor and odor. An odor control group was allowed to smell but not ingest food with novel odor. Rats in the social transmission but not control groups preferred the novel food on a trial 48h later. ACh release in prefrontal cortex, with probes that primarily sampled prelimbic cortex, did not increase during acquisition of the social transmission of food preference, suggesting that training-initiated release of ACh in prelimbic cortex is not necessary for acquisition of the food preference. In contrast, ACh release in the hippocampus increased substantially (200%) upon exposure to a rat that had eaten the novel food. Release in the hippocampus increased significantly less (25%) upon exposure to a rat that had eaten normal food and did not increase significantly in the rats exposed to the novel odor; ACh release in the social transmission group was significantly greater than that of the either of the control groups. Thus, ACh release in the hippocampus but not prelimbic cortex distinguished well the social transmission vs. control conditions, suggesting that cholinergic mechanisms in the hippocampus but not prelimbic cortex are important for acquiring a socially transmitted food preference.},

	Abstract = {Chemical intolerance is a medically unexplained affliction that implies deleterious reactions to non-toxic everyday chemical exposure. Sensitization (i.e. increased reactivity to repeated, invariant stimulation) to odorous stimulation is an important component in theoretical explanations of chemical intolerance, but empirical evidence is scarce. We hypothesized that (1) individuals who sensitize to repeated olfactory stimulation, compared with those who habituate, would express a lower blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) response in key inhibitory areas such as the rACC, and higher signal in pain/saliency detection regions, as well as primary and/or secondary olfactory projection areas; and (2) olfactory sensitization, compared with habituation, would be associated with greater self-reported chemical intolerance. Moreover, we assessed whether olfactory sensitization was paralleled by comparable trigeminal processing -- in terms of perceptual ratings and BOLD responses. We grouped women from a previous functional magnetic imaging study based on intensity ratings of repeated amyl acetate exposure over time. Fourteen women sensitized to the exposure, 15 habituated, and 20 were considered ``intermediate'' (i.e. neither sensitizers nor habituaters). Olfactory sensitizers, compared with habituaters, displayed a BOLD-pattern in line with the hypothesis, and reported greater problems with odours in everyday life. They also expressed greater reactions to CO2 in terms of both perceived intensity and BOLD signal. The similarities with pain are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Group-living animals frequently have to trade off the costs and benefits of leaving an established group and joining another group. Owing to their high fitness relevance, group-joining decisions are commonly nonrandom and may be based on traits of both individual members and the group such as life stage, body size, social status and group density or size, respectively. Many group-living animals are able to recognize and to associate preferentially with familiar individuals, i.e. those encountered before. Hence, after dispersing from established groups, animals commonly have to decide whether to join a new familiar or unfamiliar group. Using binary choice situations we assessed the effects of social familiarity on group-joining behaviour of the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. Group living in P. persimilis is brought about by the patchy distribution of its spider mite prey and mutual conspecific attraction. In the first experiment, gravid predator females given a choice between spider mite patches occupied by unfamiliar and familiar groups of females strongly preferred to join familiar groups and to deposit their eggs in these patches. Preference for socially familiar groups was robust across biases of spider mite prey densities between choice options. The second experiment revealed that the predatory mite females can smell social familiarity from a distance. Females subjected to odour choice situations in artificial cages were more strongly attracted to the odour of familiar than unfamiliar groups. We argue that P. persimilis females preferentially join socially familiar groups because a familiar social environment relaxes competition and optimizes foraging and reproduction.},

	Abstract = {Retronasal and oral-cavity-only identifications of six natural extract odorants, presented in air-phase, were compared in an initial experiment. Prior to identification testing, the 21 participants were given experience with air-phase presentations, and with the odorants and their correct identifications. Retronasal correct identifications for anise, cinnamon, coffee, orange, peppermint, and strawberry were 88%, 81%, 98%, 95%, 91%, and 83%; oral-cavity-only, 19%, 21%, 19%, 21%, 33%, and 24%. All participants correctly identified retronasal odorants above chance. Across participants only peppermint received correct oral-cavity-only identifications, but two participants gave correct oral-cavity-only identifications for all odorants. In a second experiment, different participants attempted to discriminate oral-cavity-only odorants from their solvents. Fifteen participants discriminated orange, peppermint, and strawberry odorants from their solvents, and five discriminated all odorants from their solvents. It had been hypothesized that peppermint would provide unique trigeminal stimulation; this was supported by correct oral-cavity-only identification of only peppermint. A second hypothesis posited oral-cavity-only discrimination of orange and peppermint from their solvents because of trigeminal stimuli, but strawberry extract discrimination was unexpected. Furthermore, oral-cavity-only discrimination of all odorants by one-quarter of the participants was not anticipated. Overall, these outcomes suggest that peppermint-like odorants can initiate sufficiently differential responses in the oral cavity to permit identification, indicate that not only odorants with known trigeminal stimulus components but also others may elicit oral-cavity-only air-phase responses, and imply that for a substantial minority of individuals, trigeminal input may enhance oral-cavity effectiveness of many odorants during retronasal smelling.},

	Abstract = {Isolates of Trichoderma species from hot arid regions, fungicides and their combinations were evaluated for the management of ber fruit rot at post-harvest stage. Out of 16 isolates of Trichoderma species, six isolates checked growth of mycelia of Alternaria alternata by more than 55%. A distinct variation in the inherent level of resistance in these six isolates was recorded against 13 common fungicides. None of the Trichoderma species grew in PDA amended with carbendazim even at a very low concentration. In contrast, 100 per cent radial growth was observed in Trichoderma citrinoviride isolate T.c-CIAH224 in the presence of copper oxychloride (250μgg−1) and mancozeb (100μgg−1) in PDA medium. Isolate T.v-CIAH240 was antagonistic against A. alternata and tolerant to most of the fungicides tested. This isolate was highly compatible with chlorothalonil, dinocap and wettable sulphur even at 1000μgg−1 and produced yellowish instead of normal green coloured conidia. Isolate of Trichoderma koningii -- T.k-CIAH176, T. citrinoviride -- T.c-CIAH224 and those of Trichoderma viride -- T.v-CIAH181 and T.v-CIAH240 with inherent tolerance to some of the fungicides have shown better efficacy to suppress the fruit rot pathogen in dual cultures. However isolate T.v-CIAH240 was significantly superior in vitro in the suppression (71%) of the A. alternata through mycoparasitism and apparent secretion of secondary metabolites in the growth medium. Mycoparasitism and competition with the fruit rot pathogen were the mode of action in the majority of the isolates. The growth of A. alternata was completely inhibited in PDA amended with dinocap, propiconazole and tridemorph irrespective of the concentrations. In experiments in vivo, isolate T.v-CIAH240 was significantly effective (75% PEDC- Per cent Efficiency of Disease Control) against post-harvest infection by A. alternata followed by T.v-SBI48 (62 PEDC) and T.v-CIAH149 (44 PEDC). Among the individual fungicide treatments, dinocap and copper oxychloride (50μgg−1) resulted in 52 PEDC. However, dinocap caused a scorching effect and a foul smell in fruits. Fruit rot control efficacy was enhanced to >70% by T.v-CIAH240 with tridemefon, thiophanate methyl, mancozeb or alcidine at 50μgg−1 and to >80% with 100μgg−1 of thiophanate methyl, chlorothalonil, mancozeb and alcidine in ber fruits (cv. Gola). There was a non-significant latent infection caused by isolates T.k-CIAH176, T.c-CIAH224 (T. citrinoviride) and T.v-CIAH240. Such a latent infection was completely suppressed by low concentrations of fungicides when used in combination with T.v-CIAH240. The possible hypothesis involved in management of A. alternata in ber fruits at post-harvest stages using fungicides, Trichoderma species and their combinations is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Our daily urban experiences are the product of our perceptions and senses, yet the complete sensorial range is strikingly absent from urban studies. Sight has been historically privileged over the other senses and urban studies. However, smell and sound have also a huge influence over how we perceive places, they impact our behavior, attitudes and health. Yet, city planning is concerned only with a few bad smells and with limiting noise levels. We propose a new way of capturing nuanced sensorial perceptions of cities from data implicitly generated by social media users and of producing detailed sensorial maps of our cities.},

	Abstract = {This study aims to answer the research question of ``Are early onset aging conditions correlated to daily activity functions in youth and adults with Down syndrome (DS)?'' A cross-sectional survey was employed to recruit 216 individuals with DS over 15 years of age in the analyses. A structured questionnaire included demographic data, brief self-reported aging conditions, Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID) and activity of daily living (ADL) scales were completed by the primary caregivers who were well-suited for providing information on the functioning conditions of the DS individuals. Results showed that the most five frequent aging conditions (sometimes, usually and always) included frailty (20.2%), vision problem (15.8%), loss of language ability (15.3%), sleep problem (14.9%) and memory impairment (14.5%). Other onset aging conditions included more chronic diseases (13.9%), hearing loss (13%), chewing ability and tooth loss (12.5%), incontinence (11.1%), depressive syndrome (7.7%), falls and gait disorder (7.2%), loss of taste and smell (7.2%). The data also showed scores of DSQIID, onset aging conditions and ADL has significant relationships each other in Pearson's correlation tests. Finally, multiple linear regression analyses indicated onset aging conditions (β=−0.735, p<0.001) can significantly predicted the variation in ADL scores after adjusting other factors (R2=0.381). This study suggests that the authority should initiate early intervention programs aim to improve healthy aging and ADL functions for people with DS.},

	Abstract = {The interaction between the sensory properties of food plants (i.e. taste and smell) and their postingestive consequences is thought to be an important mechanism by which browsing herbivores learn about the toxic and nutritional properties of foods. The extent to which this mechanism is important when multiple food options are available, each differing in concentrations of both nutrients and plant secondary metabolites, is little known and was tested using goats as a model browsing herbivore. Twenty-four juvenile female goats, Capra hircus, were offered branches of four conifer species, with one species being offered per day on 4 successive conditioning days per week for 5 weeks. On conditioning days, animals were dosed orally with a mixture of two stimuli according to their treatment allocations. Treatments consisted of combinations of a positive (sodium propionate) and a negative (lithium chloride) postingestive stimulus, both imposed at one of four levels. Preference was assessed on the fifth day by offering all species simultaneously for 20min and measuring relative consumption. From the first week, goats responded in a dose-dependent fashion to lithium chloride by reducing their relative preference of associated conifer species as the dose increased. However, they did not modify their choices with the variation in sodium propionate intensity. Comparisons with other experiments which did not use the conditioning method suggest that in complex situations with many stimuli, animals may need additional preingestive cues to perceive the whole value of the food, particularly for assessing nutrient rewards of food plants.},

	Abstract = {Herbivorous insects use information about volatile substances to select their host plants. The possibility that insects use these volatiles to assess the infection status of a host plant has rarely been tested. The assessment of host status via olfaction may allow a more successful allocation of time and energy towards the procurement of valuable resources for the offspring. We hypothesized that olfactory cues play a role in providing an herbivorous insect with information about the health status of a potential host plant. To test this hypothesis, we compared the attraction and oviposition response of the grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana, to healthy grapes, Vitis vinifera, with the response to grapes infected with a phytopathogenic fungus, Botrytis cinerea. The fungal infection elicited substantial reductions in both attraction from a distance and oviposition on the host. By preventing contact with the fruits, we found that volatiles from the infected grapes were the signal eliciting the observed behaviour. Experiments with a synthetic compound, 3-methyl-1-butanol, identified in the odour of infected grapes, confirmed the essential function of olfactory cues in this process, both in the laboratory and in the field. In our system, the avoidance of a diseased plant supported the preference performance hypothesis in L. botrana. Results are discussed in relation to the role of fungal volatiles in plant--insect relationships.},

	Abstract = {Objective: Filicide, or parental murder of offspring, constitutes a major portion of lethal violence perpetrated against children worldwide. Despite the global nature of the phenomenon, researchers have focused their studies on the developed industrialized societies with the consequent neglect of small, developing societies. Second, there is a paucity of empirical data on child homicide committed by fathers. This study therefore explores the nature and extent of paternal filicides in Fiji, a non-Western society, and the social and cultural forces underlying them in order to enhance our knowledge of the phenomenon. Method: Information was obtained from a number of sources, including (a) a police homicide logbook, (b) newspaper reports of homicide, and (c) detailed interviews conducted with criminal justice and medical personnel. Information from these data sources were consolidated to construct case histories of paternal filicides. These cases were then analyzed for dominant themes. Case illustrations are presented in the text. Results: Several of the study's findings are congruent with other studies of paternal filicides: poor, working class fathers were the offenders in all cases. As a corollary, their victims were from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Regarding location, paternal filicides occurred in the home of the offender and victim. The filicides were the culmination of stresses and strains associated with marital disharmony and excessive corporal child-control strategies. Conclusions: The general conclusion of this study is that further research in non-Western societies has the potential to increase our understanding of the social factors and processes involved in paternal child murders. We will then be better positioned to craft effective intervention strategies.},

	Abstract = {The EU Commission recommends using market-based support schemes for renewable-electricity projects. One example is the Swedish-Norwegian tradable green certificate scheme. We examine whether design features in the Norwegian part of this scheme, specifically, the scheme's short duration and the way it is to be abruptly terminated, contribute to investors' perceptions of barriers. We apply econometric techniques on primary data collected in two surveys of Norwegian investors in hydropower, and we use real options theory to predict and interpret investors' responses. We show that: (1) immediately after the scheme was introduced, investors are eager to lock in future subsidies by investing immediately and concerned with factors that may delay the completion of their projects; (2) as the certificate deadline neared, investors have become increasingly pessimistic and concerned with economic and risk barriers. Investors in big hydropower plants with regulation reservoirs are particularly concerned with the risk of not completing their projects in time to gain the right to sell certificates. These findings are consistent with the predicted responses to the scheme design derived from real options theory. In contrast to earlier studies, we find no difference in responses to the scheme design across investor types.},

The study conducted comprised an outsourced maintenance project involving four Java web systems with equivalent functionality but dissimilar implementation, six software professionals, and two software companies. A main result from the study is that the usefulness of code smells differs according to the granularity level (e.g., whether the assessment is done at file or system level) and the particular operationalization of maintainability (e.g., maintainability can be measured via maintenance effort, or problems encountered during maintenance, etc). This paper summarises the most relevant findings from the thesis, discusses a series of lessons learned from conducting this study, and discusses avenues for new research in the area of code smells.},

	Abstract = {This project evaluated the effects of olfactory and gustatory stimuli on the amplitude and latency of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the submental muscles when evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Sixteen healthy volunteers (8 males; age range 19--43) participated in the study. Lemon concentrate at 100% and diluted in water to 25% were presented separately as odor and tastant stimuli. Tap water was used as control. 15 trials of TMS-evoked MEPs triggered by volitional contraction of the submental muscles and volitional swallowing were measured at baseline, during control condition, during stimulus presentation, and immediately, 30-, 60-, and 90-min poststimulation for each of the four stimulus presentations. Experiments were repeated using the combined odor and tastant concentrations that most influenced the MEP independently. Differences in MEP amplitude measured during swallowing were seen at 30-, 60-, and 90-min poststimulation for simultaneous olfactory and gustatory stimulation as opposed to no differences seen at any point for stimuli presented separately. This study has shown that combined odor and tastant stimulation (i.e., flavor) can increase MEP amplitude during swallowing and that this enhancement of MEP can persist for at least 90min following stimulation. As increased MEP amplitude has been associated with improved swallowing performance, a follow-up study is underway to determine the biomechanical changes produced by altered MEPs to facilitate translation of these data to clinical dysphagia management.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Background
Self-reported annoyance from electrical equipment has been in evidence since the mid-1980s, and the first reports of illness from everyday chemicals arose in the 1960s. However, the extent of the problem has not yet been fully established.
Aims
The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of annoyance related to electrical and chemical factors in a Swedish general population, and to assess possible relationships with subjective health and daily functioning.
Methods
In total, 13,604 subjects, representative of the population of Scania, Sweden, answered a survey containing five questions regarding annoyance from five environmental factors: fluorescent tube lighting, visual display units, other electrical equipment, air that smells of chemicals, and other smells. The survey also obtained data on self-reported health (SRH-7), mental well-being [General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12], work situation and daily functioning.
Results
Almost one-third of the respondents reported annoyance from at least one environmental factor. Annoyance was more frequent among women, subjects of working age and immigrants. Subjects who reported environmental annoyance scored higher on GHQ-12 and lower on SRH-7, indicating impaired subjective physical and mental well-being. They were also more likely to report deteriorated daily functioning.
Conclusions
Annoyance related to electrical and/or chemical factors was common in a Swedish population. Subjects reporting environmental annoyance rated their overall health significantly poorer than the general population. The association with subjective health and functional capacity increased with severity of annoyance, which suggests that there is some connection between environmental annoyance, well-being and functional capacity.},

@article{MURRELL2009585,
	Abstract = {Background
In humans, lower back pain is one of the most common causes of morbidity. Many studies implicate degeneration of intervertebral discs as the cause. In the normal intervertebral disc, the nucleus pulposus exerts a hydrostatic pressure against the constraining annulus fibrosus, which allows the disc to maintain flexibility between adjacent vertebrae, while absorbing necessary compressive forces. The nucleus pulposus performs this role because of its hydrophilic gel-like structure. The extracellular matrix of the nucleus pulposus is up to 80% hydrated, as a result of large amounts of the aggregating proteoglycan, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG). This proteoglycan is enmeshed in a randomly orientated network of fine collagen Type II (CT2) fibers.
Study design and purpose
A useful adult tissue-derived stem cell is that from the olfactory mucosa, the organ of smell. These cells, accessible in humans from nasal biopsies, are multipotent and are able to make many cell types from all germ layers. They are easily grown in vitro and can be expanded to large numbers and stored frozen. These qualities indicate the potential for autologous transplantation for disc repair. In this article, using a rat model, we explore the hypothesis that olfactory stem cells can differentiate into a nucleus pulposus chondrocyte phenotype in vitro, as well as in vivo after transplantation into the injured intervertebral disc.
Patient sample
Female rats (14 weeks) were anesthetized with xylazine/ketamine. The abdominal wall was shaved and injected with local anesthetic (lidocaine) before incision. The ventral part of the lumbar spine, including two intervertebral discs, was exposed. Disc degeneration was then induced in the two exposed discs by needle aspiration of the nucleus pulposus. The prominent spina iliaca posterior superior was used as an anatomical landmark for identification of the first disc. Two weeks later, one injured intervertebral disc was exposed in a second, similar, surgery and 20,000 olfactory neurosphere-derived cells were transplanted with a 25-G needle.
Outcome measures
In vitro induction of nucleus pulposus chondrocyte phenotype is measured by the percentage of cells expressing CT2 and CSPG. In vivo, a successful outcome is evidence of engraftment of donor-derived cells and their expression of CT2 and CSPG.
Methods
In this article, we tested two hypotheses: the first that progenitor cells within olfactory neurospheres could be induced to express markers distinctive of the nucleus pulposus when placed in vitro in a coculture experiment. The second hypothesis tested the same induction in genetically labeled transplanted cells within damaged vertebral discs in vivo. The two markers measured are those held by current literature to engender the necessary cushioning characteristics of nucleus pulposus, CT2 and CSPG.
Results
Our experiments demonstrated virtually 100% induction of these two markers in vitro. Also, this induction was achieved in donor-derived cells after delivery to the nucleus pulposus region of animals whose discs had previously been lesioned 2 weeks before transplant.
Conclusions
These results provide a rationale for moving toward more extensive larger animal studies for assessment of regeneration before human trials where relief of symptoms can be more easily assessed.},

	Abstract = {The effects of sensory loss on central processing in various sensory systems have already been described. The olfactory system holds the special ability to be activated by a sensorimotor act, without the presentation of an odor. In this study, we investigated brain changes related to chronic peripheral smell loss. We included 11 anosmic patients (eight female, three male; mean age, 43.5years) with smell loss after an infection of the upper respiratory tract (mean disease duration, 4.64years) and 14 healthy controls (seven female, seven male; mean age, 30.1years) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment with a sniffing paradigm. Data were analyzed using group-independent component analysis and functional connectivity analysis. Our results revealed a spatially intact olfactory network in patients, whereas major aberrations due to peripheral loss were observed in functional connectivity through a variety of distributed brain areas. This is the first study to show the re-organization caused by the lack of peripheral input. The results of this study indicate that anosmic patients hold the ability to activate an olfaction-related functional network through the sensorimotor component of odor-perception (sniffing). The areas involved were not different from those that emerged in healthy controls. However, functional connectivity appears to be different between the two groups, with a decrease in functional connectivity in the brain in patients with chronic peripheral sensory loss. We can further conclude that the loss of the sense of smell may induce far-reaching effects in the whole brain, which lead to compensatory mechanisms from other sensory systems due to the close interconnectivity of the olfactory system with other functional networks.},

	Abstract = {Background
Prevalence surveys have consistently found that the blood pressure control rate among people with hypertension is less than 25%. Studies of telemedicine as a means of providing care to hypertensive patients have shown that this approach is effective in lowering blood pressure. Major design flaws and high operating costs, however, have hindered its adoption by physicians and patients.
Objectives
In the present commentary, the field of telemedicine, as it pertains to hypertension management, is reviewed, and the investigators' experiences in developing a new telemedicine system are outlined.
Methods
An applied qualitative case study approach was used to determine the information needs for the design of a telemedicine system. Opinions were elicited separately from type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension (n=24) and family practitioners in active clinical practice (n=18).
Results
Physician and patient focus group meetings provided key information that led to changes in the prototype system. The low level of computer and Internet use by patients in everyday life and by physicians in practice-related activities precluded their inclusion in the design of the system for information retrieval and receiving clinical alerts. For patients, the mobile phone appeared to be an acceptable alternative. The only practical, automated means to disseminate reports and alerts to physicians was by fax, which was the most universally available device in a doctor's office.
Conclusion
This tightly focused qualitative study led to the development of design principles for a prototype system, increasing the likelihood of user acceptance and improving its effectiveness.
Historique
Les {\'e}tudes de pr{\'e}valence r{\'e}v{\`e}lent constamment que le taux de contr{\^o}le de la tension art{\'e}rielle (TA) chez les hypertendus est inf{\'e}rieur {\`a} 25%. Les {\'e}tudes sur la t{\'e}l{\'e}m{\'e}decine comme moyen de soigner les hypertendus ont d{\'e}montr{\'e} que cette d{\'e}marche est efficace pour abaisser la TA. Cependant, d'importants d{\'e}fauts de conception et des frais d'exploitation {\'e}lev{\'e}s ont emp{\^e}ch{\'e} leur adoption par les m{\'e}decins et les patients.
Objectifs
Dans le pr{\'e}sent commentaire, on examine le domaine de la t{\'e}l{\'e}m{\'e}decine pour la prise en charge de l'hypertension et on expose les exp{\'e}riences des chercheurs dans l'{\'e}laboration d'un nouveau syst{\`e}me de t{\'e}l{\'e}m{\'e}decine.
M{\'e}thodologie
Une {\'e}tude de cas qualitatifs appliqu{\'e}e a permis de d{\'e}terminer les besoins d'information n{\'e}cessaires pour concevoir un syst{\`e}me de t{\'e}l{\'e}m{\'e}decine. On a obtenu l'avis distinct d'hypertendus atteints de diab{\`e}te de type 2 (n=24) et de m{\'e}decins de famille en pratique clinique active (n=18).
R{\'e}sultats
Des r{\'e}unions des groupes de travail de m{\'e}decins et de patients ont fourni de l'information capitale qui a suscit{\'e} des changements au syst{\`e}me prototype. La faible utilisation des ordinateurs et d'Internet par les patients dans leur vie quotidienne et par les m{\'e}decins dans les activit{\'e}s reli{\'e}es {\`a} leur pratique ont emp{\^e}ch{\'e} leur inclusion dans le syst{\`e}me afin d'extraire des donn{\'e}es et de recevoir des avertissements cliniques. Pour les patients, le t{\'e}l{\'e}phone cellulaire semblait constituer une solution acceptable. Le t{\'e}l{\'e}copieur {\'e}tait le seul moyen pratique et automatis{\'e} pour diffuser les rapports et les avertissements aux m{\'e}decins, l'appareil le plus universellement pr{\'e}sent au cabinet du m{\'e}decin.
Conclusion
L'{\'e}tude qualitative bien circonscrite a donn{\'e} lieu {\`a} l'{\'e}laboration des principes de conception d'un syst{\`e}me prototype afin d'accro{\^\i}tre la probabilit{\'e} d'acceptation par l'usager et l'am{\'e}lioration de son efficacit{\'e}.},

	Abstract = {Building is an important process in software development. In large software projects, build code has a high level of complexity, churn rate, and defect proneness. While several automated approaches exist to help developers in localizing faults in traditional source code and in detecting code smells in build code, fault localization techniques have not yet been developed for build code. In this work, we introduce MkFault, a tool to localize errors resulting in build crashes. MkFault monitors the execution traces from GNU Make statements that produce concrete build rules and the original code locations for each component of a rule (i.e., target, prerequisites, and recipe). It then uses a novel ranking algorithm to give suspiciousness scores to the original statements in the Makefile. In our empirical evaluation with real faults, we show that MkFault can help localize faults in Make code with high accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Anti-patterns and code smells are archetypes used for describing software design shortcomings that can negatively affect software quality, in particular maintainability. Tools, metrics and methodologies have been developed to identify these archetypes, based on the assumption that they can point at problematic code. However, recent empirical studies have shown that some of these archetypes are ubiquitous in real world programs, and many of them are found not to be as detrimental to quality as previously conjectured. We are therefore interested in revisiting common anti-patterns and code smells, and building a catalogue of cases that constitute candidates for "false positives". We propose a preliminary classification of such false positives with the aim of facilitating a better understanding of the effects of anti-patterns and code smells in practice. We hope that the development and further refinement of such a classification can support researchers and tool vendors in their endeavour to develop more pragmatic, context-relevant detection and analysis tools for anti-patterns and code smells.},

	Abstract = {Process modeling languages such as EPCs, BPMN, flow charts, UML activity diagrams, Petri nets, etc., are used to model business processes and to configure process-aware information systems. It is known that users have problems understanding these diagrams. In fact, even process engineers and system analysts have difficulties in grasping the dynamics implied by a process model. Recent empirical studies show that people make numerous errors when modeling complex business processes, e.g., about 20% of the EPCs in the SAP reference model have design flaws resulting in potential deadlocks, livelocks, etc. It seems obvious that the complexity of the model contributes to design errors and a lack of understanding. It is not easy to measure complexity, however. This paper presents three complexity metrics that have been implemented in the process analysis tool ProM. The metrics are defined for a subclass of Petri nets named Workflow nets, but the results can easily be applied to other languages. To demonstrate the applicability of these metrics, we have applied our approach and tool to 262 relatively complex Protos models made in the context of various student projects. This allows us to validate and compare the different metrics. It turns out that our new metric focusing on the structuredness outperforms existing metrics.},

The objective of this study was to analyze the onset aging conditions of adults with an intellectual disability that associated with the depression scores of their primary caregivers. A cross-sectional survey was administered to gather information from 455 caregivers of adults with an intellectual disability about their symptoms of depression which assessed by a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The 12 aging conditions of adults with an intellectual disability include physical and mental health. The results indicate that 78% of adults with an intellectual disability demonstrate aging conditions. Physical conditions associated with aging include hearing decline (66.3%), vision decline (63.6%), incontinence (44%), articulation and bone degeneration (57.9%), teeth loss (80.4), physical strength decline (81.2%), sense of taste and smell decline (52.8%), and accompanied chronic illnesses (74.6%). Mental conditions associated with aging include memory loss (77%), language ability deterioration (74.4%), poor sleep quality (74.2%), and easy onset of depression and sadness (50.3%). Aging conditions of adults with an intellectual disability (p<0.001) was one factor that significantly affected the presence of depressive symptom among caregivers after controlling demographic characteristics. Particularly, poor sleep quality of adults with an intellectual disability (yes vs. no, OR=3.807, p=0.002) was statistically correlated to the occurrence of significant depressive symptoms among their caregivers. This study suggests that the authorities should reorient community services and future policies toward the needs of family caregivers to decrease the burdens associated with caregiving.},

The anti-patterns, however, have been studied with contract-first Web Services, a service construction methodology that is much less popular in the software industry compared to code-first. We study a number of source code refactorings that can be applied at service development time to reduce the presence of anti-patterns in code-first WSDL documents. The cornerstone of these refactorings is a statistical correlation between common object-oriented (OO) metrics and the anti-patterns computed by using a data-set of real Web Services.

In addition, the putative role of both orosensorial factors (using pellets vs capsules) and social interactions (single vs groups of ten fish) was investigated. To this end, a total of 68 male tilapia of about 141$\pm$48g (mean$\pm$S.D.) were challenged, individually or in groups, to select between D1 vs D2 using pellets dispensed by self-feeders (exp. 1). In another experiment (exp. 2), 11 individual fish were challenged to select encapsulated diets with non flavour or smell proprieties (D1 vs D2), and in exp. 3 fish were challenged to self-supplementation in EAA (D1 vs D3). The results showed the ability of tilapia to avoid the EAA-deficient diet, choosing 82.2% D2 in the case of individual fish, and 80.8% D2 in the case of fish groups. Dietary selection was not directly driven by the orosensorial characteristics of food, since tilapia sustained a higher preference for D2 when fed with encapsulated diets. Finally, in exp. 3 tilapia self-supplemented the EAA deficiency by selecting a synchronised combination of D1 and D3 that matched their nutritional requirements. These findings highlighted the capacity of fish to make dietary selection based on the EAA content, which should be considered when discussing food intake regulation mechanisms, and diet formulation and supplementation with EAA.},

	Abstract = {In order to study how triphosphate, salt, glucose, ascorbate and starch, both separately and in mixture, could affect the quality and the yield of brined cod fillets, an experimental design was applied. Salt was the variable with highest pronounced effect on yield and appearance, followed by triphosphate, glucose, starch and sodium ascorbate. By treating skinless frozen/thawed cod fillets with brine consisting of 25gsalt/l, 10g triphosphate/l, 5g glucose/l, 5gsodium ascorbate/l and 5gstarch/l in a vacuum tumbler for 15min, a 35% weight increase was obtained. The products retained a natural appearance with a homogenous surface. Next, an experiment was carried out to assess the effect of this brining mixture on sensory properties and consumers liking of both fresh and frozen/thawed cod fillets. Sensory analyses showed that the intensity of the sensory attributes cod taste, cod smell, juiciness, whiteness and glossiness could be heightened by brining, while the intensities of old/stale taste and smell could be lowered. The effects were prominent for products subjected to freezing before and/or after processing, while the characteristics of the fresh products were little influenced by brining. Using an in-house consumer panel, it was shown that the frozen/thawed products were the less preferred products. However, brining considerably enhanced the preferences for frozen and thawed cod fillets, obtaining preferences similar to the fresh, nonbrined product (F).},

	Abstract = {Purpose
To assess the beliefs and attitudes related to narghile (waterpipe) smoking that are likely to contribute to its increased popularity among young people in Syria.
Methods
In 2003, a cross-sectional survey was administered to university students in Aleppo, using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Overall, 587 students participated in the study (278 males, 309 females; mean age, 21.8 $\pm$ 2.1; response rate 98.8%).
Results
The most common positive perceptions of narghile were related to its smell and taste. Negative perceptions of narghile included the smoke produced, the pollution, and perceived adverse health effects. Students believed the popularity of narghile to be part of a rising regional trend in its use, due to its being an appealing way to spend leisure time socializing with friends. More students (49.7%) believed narghile to be more harmful to health than cigarettes, compared with 30% who believed the opposite. Respiratory disease was the most commonly cited health effect of narghile smoking. Family attitudes regarding tobacco use by younger members were more permissive about narghile compared with cigarettes, and, surprisingly, were more permissive about females smoking narghile than males doing so.
Conclusions
The rise in narghile smoking as a trendy social habit appears to be occurring despite considerable appreciation of its potential health risks. Permissiveness of adult family members towards narghile use by young female members, especially in the presence of a strong taboo against female cigarette smoking may contribute to the continuous spread of narghile smoking among women in Syria.},

	Abstract = {Typical burnt smell often results from fire accidents or in general from incomplete combustion. Recently, eleven compounds were identified, which are basically responsible for this odour. When analyzing residual materials from different fire accidents, the pattern that means the relative ratios of these compounds among each other varies strongly, although always causing a burnt smelling. Consequently, lab-scale combustion experiments were performed in order to investigate the influence of defined materials from domestic environment on the burnt-smell fingerprints. Furthermore, the occurrence of other polar and higher molecular combustion products was studied. It was found that under good combustion conditions, the burnt smell patterns resulting from the single materials were astonishingly consistent, mostly dominated by methylphenols or naphthalene. No correlation could be found between these `fingerprints' and combustion product groups identified by GC/MS-screenings. LC/MS/MS-measurements especially pointed at the existence of higher molecular weight phenolic and acidic functionalized compounds in the combustion residues.},

	Abstract = {Build process is crucial in software development. However, the analysis support for build code is still limited. In this paper, we present SYMake, an infrastructure and tool for the analysis of build code in make. Due to the dynamic nature of make language, it is challenging to understand and maintain complex Makefiles. SYMake provides a symbolic evaluation algorithm that processes Makefiles and produces a symbolic dependency graph (SDG), which represents the build dependencies (i.e. rules) among files via commands. During the symbolic evaluation, for each resulting string value in an SDG that represents a part of a file name or a command in a rule, SYMake provides also an acyclic graph (called T-model) to represent its symbolic evaluation trace. We have used SYMake to develop algorithms and a tool 1) to detect several types of code smells and errors in Makefiles, and 2) to support build code refactoring, e.g. renaming a variable/target even if its name is fragmented and built from multiple substrings. Our empirical evaluation for SYMake's renaming on several real-world systems showed its high accuracy in entity renaming. Our controlled experiment showed that with SYMake, developers were able to understand Makefiles better and to detect more code smells as well as to perform refactoring more accurately.},

Smell has a strong link to memory and emotion so may be a good way to cue recall when searching. Our study compared text and smell based tagging. For the first stage we generated a set of smell and tag names from user de-scriptions of photos, participants then used these to tag pho-tos, returning two weeks later to answer questions on their photos. Results showed that participants could tag effec-tively with text labels, as this is a common and familiar task. Performance with smells was lower but participants performed significantly above chance, with some partici-pants using smells well. This suggests that smell has poten-tial. Results also showed that some smells were consistently identified and useful, but some were not and highlighted issues with smell delivery devices. We also discuss some practical issues of using smell for interaction.},

The focus of this this paper is on olfaction-enhanced multimedia, which concerns itself with associating computer-generated smell with other media. However, the lingering nature of smell, as opposed to the transitory nature of other media objects that multimedia applications are accustomed to, such as video and audio, means that specific attention needs to be given when synchronizing other media content with olfactory data. Consequently, this paper presents the results of an experimental study carried out to explore and investigate the temporal boundaries within which olfactory-data output in an olfaction-enhanced multimedia application can be successfully synchronized with other media objects from an end-user perspective. Results show the presence of two main synchronization regions, and that olfaction ahead of audiovisual content is more tolerable than olfaction behind content.},

	Abstract = {Using the Australian Time Use survey (TUS), this study examined time allocation among working parents raising children with disabilities. Findings showed that raising children with disabilities reduced the time working mothers had for leisure activities, but increased the time for socializing activities. Consistent with the literature, the latter effect probably reflects the special need of working mothers raising children with disabilities for strong social networks offering regular support. While a mother's time for personal care was reduced by a child with a disability, a father's time for personal care was unaffected. Thus, mothers were relatively more disadvantaged than fathers in terms of total time for themselves. This study offers new knowledge on the impact of childhood disability on working parents' time for personal care and leisure, activities that can improve their psychological and physical well-being.},

To better understand the C preprocessor challenges, we conducted 40 interviews and a survey among 202 developers. We found that developers deal with three common problems: configuration-related bugs, combinatorial testing, and code comprehension. To safely evolve preprocessor-based configurable systems, we proposed strategies to detect preprocessor-related bugs and bad smells, and a set of 16 refactorings to remove bad smells. To better deal with exponential configuration spaces, we compared 10 sampling algorithms with respect to effort (i.e., number of configurations to test) and bug-detection capabilities (i.e., number of bugs detected in the sampled configurations). Based on the results, we proposed a sampling algorithm with a useful balance between effort and bug-detection capability. By evaluating the proposed solution using 40 popular projects, we found 131 preprocessor-related bugs and more than 5K opportunities to apply the refactorings in practice.},

In Object-Oriented (OO) systems, this often results in packages that are hard to understand and maintain, as they group together heterogeneous classes with unrelated responsibilities. In such cases, state-of-the-art re-modularization tools solve the problem by proposing a new organization of the existing classes into packages. However, as indicated by recent empirical studies, such approaches require changing thousands of lines of code to implement the new recommended modularization. In this demo, we present the implementation of an Extract Package refactoring approach in ARIES (Automated Refactoring In EclipSe), a tool supporting refactoring operations in Eclipse. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches, ARIES automatically identifies and removes single low-cohesive packages from software systems, which represent localized design flaws in the package organization, with the aim to incrementally improve the overall quality of the software modularisation.},

	Abstract = {During software maintenance and evolution the internal structure of the software system undergoes continuous changes. These modifications drift the source code away from its original design, thus deteriorating its quality, including cohesion and coupling of classes. Several refactoring methods have been proposed to overcome this problem. In this paper we propose a novel technique to identify Move Method refactoring opportunities and remove the Feature Envy bad smell from source code. Our approach, coined as Methodbook, is based on relational topic models (RTM), a probabilistic technique for representing and modeling topics, documents (in our case methods) and known relationships among these. Methodbook uses RTM to analyze both structural and textual information gleaned from software to better support move method refactoring. We evaluated Methodbook in two case studies. The first study has been executed on six software systems to analyze if the move method operations suggested by Methodbook help to improve the design quality of the systems as captured by quality metrics. The second study has been conducted with eighty developers that evaluated the refactoring recommendations produced by Methodbook. The achieved results indicate that Methodbook provides accurate and meaningful recommendations for move method refactoring operations.},

	Abstract = {Nowadays, attacking and defending Android apps has be- come an arms race between black hats and white hats. In this paper, we explore a new hacking technique called the App Confusion Attack, which allows hackers to take full control of benign apps and their resources without device root- ing or privilege escalation. Conceptually, an App Confusion Attack hijacks the launching process of each benign app, and forces it to run in a virtual execution context controlled by hackers, instead of the native one provided by the Android Application Framework. This attack is furtive but lethal. When a user clicks on a benign app, the malicious alternative can be loaded and executed with an indistinguishable user interface. As a result, hackers can manipulate the communication between the benign app and the OS, including kernel and system services, and manipulate the code and data at will. To address this issue, we build DroidPill, a framework for malware creation that employs the app virtualization technique and the design flaws in Android to achieve such attacks with free apps. Our evaluation results and case studies show that DroidPill is practical and effective. Lastly, we conclude this work with several possible countermeasures to the App Confusion Attack.},

	Abstract = {The cost to repair a requirements-based defect in softwarebased systems increases substantially with each successive phase of the software lifecycle in which the error is allowed to propagate. While tools exist to facilitate early detection of design flaws, such tools do not detect flaws in system requirements, thus allowing such flaws to propagate into system design and implementation. This paper describes an experience report using a toolchain that supports a novel combination of structural and behavioral analysis of UML state diagrams that is not currently available in commercial UML modeling tools. With the toolchain, models can be incrementally and systematically improved through syntaxbased analysis, type checking, and detection of latent behavioral system properties, including feature interactions. This paper demonstrates use of the toolchain on an industry-provided model of onboard electronics for an automotive application.},

	Abstract = {Code smells represent code decay and as such should be eradicated from a system to prevent future maintenance problems. A range of twenty smells described by Fowler and Beck each require varying numbers and combinations of refactorings in order to be eradicated - but exactly how many are needed when we consider related, nested refactorings is unclear. In this paper, we enumerate these refactorings when categorised according to Mantyla's smell taxonomy. We then show how, ironically, the `smelliest' of smells (and hence most difficult to eradicate) are actually those best understood by developers. So, code smells are not only unpleasant to have around but are deceptive in their nature and make-up. The study is thus a warning against attempting what are seemingly easily eradicated smells - these are often the smells the developer needs to be most wary of.},

	Abstract = {To clarify the contribution of stress to classical conditioning-associated asthmatic responses, the effect of fasting stress on conditioned histamine release was investigated in a guinea pig model of asthma. The animals were randomly divided into 2 groups for Experiment 1 and 2, and received a conditioning procedure in which ovalbumin (OA) as an unconditioned stimulus (US) and dimethylsulfide (DMS, sulfur smelling) as a conditioned stimulus (CS) were simultaneously inhaled after fasting for 16 h. Then, one group was given food as a reward for respiratory distress, and the other group was denied it for more than 3 h, while being placed in front of the feeding group. After this procedure was repeated 5 times, the plasma histamine levels in response to the CS were measured in half of each group in Experiment 1, and the respiratory resistance (Rrs) was assessed similarly in the other half of each group in Experiment 2. The same experiments were again performed after exchanging assignments of feeding group or fasting group in both experiments. The control groups in both experiments received the CS and the US 10 times separately in a random order under 16 h fasting conditions and were provided food after the exposures. After these pseudo-conditioning presentations, the plasma histamine levels or the Rrs in response to the CS were measured. In Experiment 1, the plasma histamine levels in the fasting stress group after the first conditioning sessions were significantly higher than those of the other groups. This difference was not observed when the groups were exchanged. In Experiment 2, the fasting stress group showed higher values in the Rrs compared to the other groups, irrespective of the first or second conditionings; however, they were not significant. The present study indicates that fasting stress after the conditioning procedures exacerbates the following conditioned histamine release, although the stress effect on bronchoconstriction was not confirmed.},

	Abstract = {Ensuring aircraft stay safely separated is the primary consideration in air traffic control. To achieve the required level of assurance for this safety-critical application, the Automated Airspace Concept (AAC) proposes a network of components providing multiple levels of separation assurance, including conflict detection and resolution. In our previous work, we conducted a formal study of this concept including specification, validation, and verification utilizing the NuSMV and CadenceSMV model checkers to ensure there are no potentially catastrophic design flaws remaining in the AAC design before the next stage of production. In this paper, we extend that work to include probabilistic model checking of the AAC system.1 We are motivated by the system designers requirement to compare different design options to optimize the functional allocation of the AAC components. Probabilistic model checking provides quantitative measures for evaluating different design options, helping system designers to understand the impact of parameters in the model on a given critical safety requirement. We detail our approach to modeling and probabilistically analyzing this complex system consisting of a real-time algorithm, a logic protocol, and human factors. We utilize both Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) and Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) models to capture the important behaviors in the AAC components. The separation assurance algorithms, which are defined over specific time ranges, are modeled using a DTMC. The emergence of conflicts in an airspace sector and the reaction times of pilots, which can be simplified as Markov processes on continuous time, are modeled as a CTMC. Utilizing these two models, we calculate the probability of an unresolved conflict as a measure of safety and compare multiple design options.},

However, these methods are operator dependent, time-consuming, expensive, and require special skills, and are therefore, not suitable for point-of-care testing. Recent developments in gas-sensing technology and pattern recognition methods make electronic nose technology an interesting alternative for medical point-of-care devices. An electronic nose has been used to detect urinary tract infection from 45 suspected cases that were sent for analysis in a U.K. Public Health Registry. These samples were analyzed by incubation in a volatile generation test tube system for 4-5 h. Two issues are being addressed, including the implementation of an advanced neural network, based on a modified expectation maximization scheme that incorporates a dynamic structure methodology and the concept of a fusion of multiple classifiers dedicated to specific feature parameters. This study has shown the potential for early detection of microbial contaminants in urine samples using electronic nose technology.},

	Abstract = {Background
Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a chronic illness of progressive recurrent sinus disease with nasal polyps and asthma. No population-based comprehensive surveys of patients with AERD have been carried out to assess specific quality-of-life impact or perceptions of treatment benefit.
Objective
This survey analyzed perceptions and quality of life in those living with AERD and queried patient observations of treatment effectiveness. The survey assessed whether dietary and nutritional support was used to manage AERD, and if so, whether there was a perceived benefit.
Methods
This survey was publicized through clinics that treat patients with AERD, Web sites, and online blogs.
Results
Results are reported for 190 patients. Most subjects reported an adverse effect of AERD on quality of life. Chronic nasal symptoms followed by decreased sense of smell were reported to have the greatest impact on quality of life---in 81 (43%) and 74 (39%), respectively. Those who lost their ability to smell (n = 65; 34%) reported that they missed the enjoyment of food and eating the most. A minority indicated that a combination of medications (aspirin, leukotriene receptor antagonist, zileuton, or omalizumab) was more effective than 1 alone. Of those surveyed, 120 (63%) respondents felt that components of their diet contributed to their disease and 147 (77%) respondents reported having reactions after alcohol consumption.
Conclusions
Patients with AERD live with frustration and report a poor quality of life in spite of several pharmacologic treatments including aspirin desensitization followed by daily aspirin. Despite ongoing medical therapy, the burden of disease in AERD remains high.},

	Abstract = {For years, individual recognition has been the subject of many studies but, owing to the intrinsic complexity of the phenomenon, it has also been the source of much controversy. The sensory channel(s) used for recognition has also been much discussed. In aquatic invertebrates, vision has been one of the least understood media. We carried out two laboratory experiments using 49 pairs of adult male American lobsters. The first experiment was aimed at investigating the sensory channel/s (smell, sight or the two combined) used by lobsters to get information about the opponent, whereas in the second experiment we tested whether visual experience might allow lobsters to recognize the familiar opponent. Previous exposure to the sight of a conspecific induced lobsters either to avoid the opponent or to skip preliminaries (approaches and threats) and escalate the interaction. However, such changes in the dynamics of fighting were shown only when the opponent was the individual that the experimental lobster had previously seen rather than a generic lobster. This is the first study to provide evidence that lobsters can identify familiar conspecifics by sight, although this does not necessarily mean that they recognize them as individuals. Further studies are needed to clarify this issue.},

	Abstract = {It is well-known that software maintenance is an arduous task. It is particularly so because of poor design decisions made by software engineers during the development phase. Past research has shown that there are smells in the code that can be used to gauge the quality of the project. Nevertheless, code maintenance due to these research tools is still costly because they are focused on curative solutions rather than preventive measures.
Majority of the past research techniques detect code smells after the fact; and the classification of code changes rely on the commit messages written by the developers. However, developers do not always mention the necessary meta-data to determine the changes. The goal of my research is to find a set of design and implementation change categories using abstract syntax trees from the code rather than the commit messages. The categories will help classify the common changes in software projects and identify the resulting unstable regions. A rule-based system will be developed using these regions to recommend the potential improvements required to stabilize the code-base.
The result of my research will contribute a toolset that will be used from the start of the development phase to evaluate the stability of the system using software metrics and recommend improvements. This will help project managers mitigate the design and implementation flaws early on during the product life-cycle and reduce the cost during the maintenance phase. Hence, the toolset will have the potential to change the software maintenance paradigm from corrective to preventative measures.},

	Abstract = {The Victorian Space Science Education Centre (VSSEC) scenario-based programs, including the Mission to Mars and Mission to the Orbiting Space Laboratory, utilize methodologies such as hands-on applications, immersive learning, integrated technologies, critical thinking and mentoring. The use of a scenario provides a real-life context and purpose to what students might otherwise consider disjointed information. These programs engage students in the areas of maths and science, and highlight potential career paths in science and engineering. The introduction of a scenario-based program for primary students engages students in maths and science at a younger age, addressing the issues of basic numeracy and science literacy, thus laying the foundation for stronger senior science initiatives. Primary students absorb more information within the context of the scenario, and presenting information they can see, hear, touch and smell creates a memorable learning and sensory experience. The mission also supports development of teacher skills in the delivery of hands-on science and helps build their confidence to teach science. The Primary Mission to the Mars Base gives primary school students access to an environment and equipment not available in schools. Students wear flight suits for the duration of the program to immerse them in the experience of being an astronaut. Astronauts work in the VSSEC Space Laboratory, which is transformed into a Mars base for the primary program, to conduct experiments in areas such as robotics, human physiology, microbiology, nanotechnology and environmental science. Specialist mission control software has been developed by La Trobe University Centre for Games Technology to provide age appropriate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based problem solving and support the concept of a mission. Students in Mission Control observe the astronauts working in the space laboratory and talk to them via the AV system. This interactive environment promotes high order thinking skills such as problem solving, team work, communication skills and leadership. To promote the teaching of science in the classroom, and prepare the students for their mission, the program includes a pre-visit program. These classroom-based lessons model best practice in effective science teaching and learning to support the development of confident primary science teachers.},

	Abstract = {Models and modelling are effective approaches to describe events or activities of systems or environment. An error or design flaw in the models can cause failures in applications utilizing these models. Therefore, an effective testing and validation approach is required for identifying possible errors and misunderstandings. This paper proposes a process for testing and validating intrusion models used in network intrusion detection. The process can be integrated as part of the intrusion model development process with proper tool support. This will help to identify possible errors in the intrusion model as early as possible. The contribution is to apply well-known aspects from software testing and implement them in the intrusion model testing and validation. The experimental implementation of the proposed process will concentrate on testing intrusion models focusing on detecting port scan attacks. This experiment will indicate that when the testing and validation is part of the intrusion model development process, the intrusion model developer receives immediate feedback and can quickly refine the intrusion model. This increases the confidence of the intrusion model and errors and design misunderstandings are located effectively.},

	Abstract = {Solitarious nymphs of Schistocerca gregaria were reared under various conditions in both Jerusalem and Oxford to tease apart cues involved in behavioural and colour phase change. Treatments included rearing nymphs from the IInd or IIIrd until the final nymphal stadium in physical contact with similarly aged conspecific groups or with another locust species, Locusta migratoria migratorioides, as well as confining single nymphs in mesh cages, which were kept within crowds of S. gregaria or L. migratoria migratorioides, providing visual and olfactory but no physical contact with other locusts. In the Oxford experiments, an extra treatment was included which provided olfactory cues without visual or contact stimulation. Our results confirm that transformation from the solitarious to the gregarious phase of locusts is complex, and that different phase characteristics not only follow different time courses, but are also controlled by different suites of cues. As predicted from earlier studies, behavioural phase change was evoked by non-species-specific cues. Rearing in contact with either species was fully effective in inducing gregarious behaviour, as was the combination of the sight and smell of other locusts, but odour alone was ineffective. Colour phase change was shown to comprise two distinct elements that could be dissociated: black patterning and yellow background. The former of these could be induced as effectively by rearing S. gregaria nymphs in a crowd of L. migratoria migratorioides as by rearing with conspecifics. Sight and smell of other locusts also triggered black patterning and, unlike behavioural change, some black patterning was induced by odour cues alone. Hence, physical contact was not needed to induce gregarious black patterning. Yellow colouration, however, was only fully induced when locusts were reared in contact with conspecifics, implying the presence of a species-specific contact chemical cue.},

However, the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to the destination. It has the power to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination. A few years ago, my research started to focus on understanding how people psychologically experience the city. I used computer science tools to replicate social science experiments at scale, at web scale [4,5]. I became captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by Jane Jacobs, Stanley Milgram, Kevin Lynch[1,2,3]. The result of that research has been the creation of new maps, maps where one does not only find the shortest path but also the most enjoyable path [6,9].
We did so by building a new city map weighted for human emotions. On this cartography, one is not only able to see and connect from point A to point B the shortest segments, but one is also able to see the happy path, the beautiful path, the quiet path. In tests, participants found the happy, the beautiful, the quiet paths far more enjoyable than the shortest one, and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time. Participants also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded. So what if we had a mapping tool that would return the most enjoyable routes based not only on aesthetics but also based on smell and sound?

	Abstract = {Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises an unprecedented volume of structured data on the Web. However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced or extracted data of often relatively low quality. We present a methodology for test-driven quality assessment of Linked Data, which is inspired by test-driven software development. We argue that vocabularies, ontologies and knowledge bases should be accompanied by a number of test cases, which help to ensure a basic level of quality. We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data resources, based on a formalization of bad smells and data quality problems. Our formalization employs SPARQL query templates, which are instantiated into concrete quality test case queries. Based on an extensive survey, we compile a comprehensive library of data quality test case patterns. We perform automatic test case instantiation based on schema constraints or semi-automatically enriched schemata and allow the user to generate specific test case instantiations that are applicable to a schema or dataset. We provide an extensive evaluation of five LOD datasets, manual test case instantiation for five schemas and automatic test case instantiations for all available schemata registered with Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV). One of the main advantages of our approach is that domain specific semantics can be encoded in the data quality test cases, thus being able to discover data quality problems beyond conventional quality heuristics.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
The purpose of this review was to assess the relationship between mean organoleptic scores (using a 0-to-5 scale) and concentrations of putative odorants representative of those thought to be important in oral malodor, as well as to propose a simple model that explains the dose-response curves obtained from a group of odor judges.
Methods
The model assumes that the scale is rooted at the detection threshold (0), the maximum score (5) is fully saturating and the brain and olfactory nervous system can act as a faithful transducer of the state of binding (occupancy) of the smell receptors in the nose. The authors predicted that the response would be exponential or sigmoidal in nature. They tested this using published empirical data based on seven odor judges and eight odor compounds.
Results
Analysis of the data by different plotting methods showed the odorants to be significantly different from each other (P < .01 by regression analysis) with regard to thresholds and slopes. The lower the threshold, the stronger the inherent odor of the compound. The greater the slope, the greater the odor power. Volatile sulfur compounds had low smell thresholds and high odor power and were highly volatile, while indole was less volatile but had a very low threshold. Both compounds may be significant in human oral malodor.
Conclusions
The authors found that the organoleptic scale was exponential in practice. These findings imply that when inhibitory agents are tested against odor-generating bacteria, a given percentage inhibition of the volatile compound production rate by a treatment (such as an antimicrobial mouthwash) will result in an equal incremental reduction on the scale, regardless of the starting position on the scale. Understanding the scale enables dental professionals to develop better ways of training, calibrating and standardizing odor judges, along with better ways of designing clinical trials and interpreting data regarding the efficacy of antiodor treatments.},

	Abstract = {This research identifies and tests key factors that can be associated with time to recall a product. Product recalls due to safety hazards entail societal costs, such as property damage, injury, and sometimes death. For firms, the related external failure costs are many, including the costs of recalling the product, providing a remedy, meeting the legal liability, and repairing damage to the firm's reputation. The recent spate of product recalls has shifted attention from why products are recalled to why it takes so long to recall a defective product that poses a safety hazard. To address this, our research subjects to empirical scrutiny the time to recall and its relationship with recall strategies, source of the defect and supply chain position of the recalling firm. We develop and verify our conceptual arguments in the U.S. toy industry by analyzing over 500 product recalls during a 15-year period (1993--2008). The empirical results indicate that the time to recall, as measured by difference between product recall announcement date and product first sold date, is associated with (1) the recall strategy (preventive vs. reactive) adopted by the firm, (2) the type of product defect (manufacturing defect vs. design flaw), and (3) the supply chain entity that issues the recall (toy company vs. distributor vs. retailer). Our results provide cues that could trigger a firm's recognition of factors that increase the time to recall.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic systems in DNA nanotechnology are often programmed using a chemical reaction network (CRN) model as an intermediate level of abstraction. In this paper, we design and analyze a CRN model of a watchdog timer, a device commonly used to monitor the health of a safety critical system. Our process uses incremental design practices with goal-oriented requirements engineering, software verification tools, and custom software to help automate the software engineering process. The watchdog timer is comprised of three components: an absence detector, a threshold filter, and a signal amplifier. These components are separately designed and verified, and only then composed to create the molecular watchdog timer. During the requirements-design iterations, simulation, model checking, and analysis are used to verify the system. Using this methodology several incomplete requirements and design flaws were found, and the final verified model helped determine specific parameters for biological experiments.},

	Abstract = {The negative impact of smells on the quality of a software systems has been empirical investigated in several studies. This has recalled the need to have approaches for the identification and the removal of smells. While approaches to remove smells have investigated the use of both structural and conceptual information extracted from source code, approaches to identify smells are based on structural information only. In this paper, we bridge the gap analyzing to what extent conceptual information, extracted using textual analysis techniques, can be used to identify smells in source code. The proposed textual-based approach for detecting smells in source code, coined as TACO (Textual Analysis for Code smell detectiOn), has been instantiated for detecting the Long Method smell and has been evaluated on three Java open source projects. The results indicate that TACO is able to detect between 50% and 77% of the smell instances with a precision ranging between 63% and 67%. In addition, the results show that TACO identifies smells that are not identified by approaches based on solely structural information.},

There are certain issues with the testing strategies used for finding bugs in the software systems such as objectives of testing, procedure used to test new functions, maximum resources and time needed to execute the project and the environment in which testing needs to be carried out. There is an enormous requirement to carry out testing process in a more suitable way due to the enlarged complications in the development of software systems.

	Abstract = {Code smells codify poor coding patterns known to degrade software quality. Block-based languages have proven to be a viable educational and end-user programming paradigm with increasing adoption across a broad spectrum of users and domains. This rising popularity of this programming paradigm calls for a serious look at the program quality written in block-based languages. While code smells in the context of text-based languages have been studied extensively, the research community lacks a comprehensive understanding of code smells in block-based software. To address this problem, we present the results of a large-scale study of code smells prevalent in programs written in the highly popular Scratch programming language. We analyzed programs submitted to the public Scratch repository in 2016, considering a million programs altogether. We discovered interesting relationships between the prevalence of certain smells and the levels of proficiency of the programmers commonly introducing them. Our findings not only can help block-based programmers improve the quality of their software, but also establish the requirements for refactoring support in this programming domain.},

In JavaScript (JS) Web applications, JS usage patterns in their source code have special characteristics that pose challenges in pattern mining. They involve nested data objects with no corresponding names or types. JS functions can be also used as data objects. JS usages are often cross-language, inter-procedural, and involve control and data flow dependencies among JS program entities and data objects whose data types are revealed only at run time due to dynamic typing in JS. This paper presents JSModel, a novel graph-based representation for JS usages, and JSMiner, a scalable approach to mine inter-procedural, data-oriented JS usage patterns. Our empirical evaluation on several Web programs shows that JSMiner efficiently detects more JS patterns with higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art approach. We conducted experiments to show JSModel's usefulness in two applications: detecting anti-patterns (buggy patterns) and documenting JS APIs via pattern skeletons. Our controlled experiment shows that the mined patterns are useful as JS documentation and code templates.},

	Abstract = {After the Swiss government's decision to decommission its five nuclear power plants by 2035, energy production from wind, biomass, biogas and photovoltaic is expected to increase significantly. Due to its many aspects of a direct democracy, high levels of public acceptance are necessary if a substantial increase in new renewable energy power plants is to be achieved in Switzerland. A survey of 502 citizens living near 19 biogas plants was conducted as the basis for using structural equation modeling to measure the effects of perceived benefits, perceived costs, trust towards the plant operator, perceived smell, information received and participation options on citizens' acceptance of ``their'' biogas plant. Results show that local acceptance towards existing biogas power plants is relatively high in Switzerland. Perceived benefits and costs as well as trust towards the plant operator are highly correlated and have a significant effect on local acceptance. While smell perception and information received had a significant effect on local acceptance as well, no such effect was found for participation options. Reasons for the non-impact of participation options on local acceptance are discussed, and pathways for future research are presented.},

	Abstract = {Food intake is an essential human activity regulated by homeostatic and hedonic systems in the brain which has mostly been ignored by the cognitive neurosciences. Yet, the study of food intake integrates fundamental cognitive and emotional processes in the human brain, and can in particular provide evidence on the neural correlates of the hedonic experience central to guiding behaviour. Neuroimaging experiments provide a novel basis for the further exploration of the brain systems involved in the conscious experience of pleasure and reward, and thus provide a unique method for studying the hedonic quality of human experience. Recent neuroimaging experiments have identified some of the regions involved in the cortical networks mediating hedonic experience in the human brain, with the evidence suggesting that the orbitofrontal cortex is the perhaps strongest candidate for linking food and other kinds of reward to hedonic experience. Based on the reviewed literature, a model is proposed to account for the roles of the different parts of the orbitofrontal cortex in this hedonic network.},

	Abstract = {The human larynx is a versatile organ. Main functions are phonation, protection and regulation of the air ways. Patients suffer severely from the diagnosis of a laryngeal carcinoma of the stages T3 and T4. In most cases this diagnosis will lead to a total laryngectomy, which is usually dissatisfying in the sense of postoperative rehabilitation. The postoperative consequences include the loss of the native voice, the loss of regular air ways via mouth and nose, sense of smell, and the inability to build up an abdominal pressure. In this paper we focus on the feasibility of a modular larynx prosthesis which enables the laryngectomee to talk with his native voice, to breathe via the regular air ways, and to build up abdominal pressure. In particular we will give insights for a postoperative solution - a modular prosthesis based on a biomimetic self-regulating double clack-valve and on a voice reconstruction module, a so called vocoder. The vocoder is a device to reproduce the natural human voice. Most important for the use is an additional device required to analyze, conserve and manage voice characteristics of the patient before surgery. The self-regulating double clack-valve is designed to build up an abdominal pressure e.g. to cough. Therefore, our valve-system is working in both directions - a two-way valve system. By bridging the gap of the regular air ways lost by laryngectomy, the sense of smell and taste are restored. In the following we will present details and characteristics of these two main components required for a modular prosthesis of the larynx in laryngectomees.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel, smart sensing system developed for the flavour analysis of liquids. The system comprises both a so-called ``electronic tongue'' based on shear horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) sensors analysing the liquid phase and a so-called ``electronic nose'' based on chemFET sensors analysing the gaseous phase. Flavour is generally understood to be the overall experience from the combination of oral and nasal stimulation and is principally derived from a combination of the human senses of taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction). Thus, by combining two types of microsensors, an artificial flavour sensing system has been developed. Initial tests conducted with different liquid samples, i.e. water, orange juice and milk (of different fat content), resulted in 100% discrimination using principal components analysis; although it was found that there was little contribution from the electronic nose. Therefore further flavour experiments were designed to demonstrate the potential of the combined electronic nose/tongue flavour system. Consequently, experiments were conducted on low vapour pressure taste-biased solutions and high vapour pressure, smell-biased solutions. Only the combined flavour analysis system could achieve 100% discrimination between all the different liquids. We believe that this is the first report of a SAW-based analysis system that determines flavour through the combination of both liquid and headspace analysis.},

When a spreadsheet evolves, these cell clusters can degenerate due to ad hoc modifications or undisciplined copy-and-pastes. Such degenerated clusters no longer keep cells prescribing the same computational semantics, and are said to exhibit ambiguous computation smells. Our empirical study finds that such smells are common and likely harmful. We propose AmCheck, a novel technique that automatically detects and repairs ambiguous computation smells by recovering their intended computational semantics.

Less is known about other innate and evolutionary-based reactions to unfairness, such as those that manifest themselves through our senses. In three experiments, we found that interpersonally unfair treatment at work, defined as treatment that violates an individual's sense of dignity and respect, triggered disgust emotions over and above anger which subsequently related to stronger taste and smell reactions to gustatory and olfactory stimuli. This effect was observed for pleasant and unpleasant tasting products, for agreeable and malodorous scents, and among both mistreatment victims and third parties. Our findings suggest that violations of dignity and respect can trigger an evolutionary based reaction that activates a human alarm system, warning individuals of impending threats even when no oral threat is imminent.},

However, there is a limited number of studies empirically investigating the actual motivations behind specific refactoring operations applied by developers. To fill this gap, we monitored Java projects hosted on GitHub to detect recently applied refactorings, and asked the developers to explain the reasons behind their decision to refactor the code. By applying thematic analysis on the collected responses, we compiled a catalogue of 44 distinct motivations for 12 well-known refactoring types. We found that refactoring activity is mainly driven by changes in the requirements and much less by code smells. Extract Method is the most versatile refactoring operation serving 11 different purposes. Finally, we found evidence that the IDE used by the developers affects the adoption of automated refactoring tools.},

However, there is little guidance to support software teams on efficient identification of code smells. In this research, we investigate how to improve efficiency on the collaborative identification of code smells. Our investigation is based on a set of controlled experiments conducted with more than 58 novice and professional developers.

Due to their distinct activation mechanisms and biophysical properties, TRP channels are highly suited to function in receptor cells, either as receptors for environmental or endogenous stimuli or as molecular players in signal transduction cascades downstream of metabotropic receptors. As such, TRP channels play a crucial role in many mammalian senses, including touch, taste and smell. Starting with a brief survey of sensory TRP channels in invertebrate model systems, this review covers the current state of research on TRP channel function in the classical mammalian senses and summarizes how modulation of TRP channels can tune our sensations.},

Different approaches define and apply their own quality models, which are composed of single metrics or combinations thereof, to operationalize software design. However, single metrics are too fine-grained to identify core design flaws and they cannot provide hints for making design improvements. In order to deal with these weaknesses of metric-based models, rules-based approaches have proven successful in the realm of source-code quality. Moreover, for developing a well-designed software system, design principles play a key role, as they define fundamental guidelines and help to avoid pitfalls. Therefore, this thesis will enhance and complete a rule-based quality reference model for operationalizing design principles and will provide a measuring tool that implements these rules. The validation of the design quality model and the measurement tool will be based on various industrial projects. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative surveys will be conducted in order to get validated results on the value of object-oriented design principles for software development.},

We performed T-maze experiments in which maze arms were connected with the subject bird's burrow and with the burrow of a conspecific neighbour. Of 23 birds, 16 were able to recognize the arm leading to their own burrow. In a second experiment, we positioned the maze in front of the subject's burrow but the maze arms were closed and did not enter the burrow. Consequently, no burrow odours could be sensed by the bird. In this case, 85% of birds (17 of 20) failed to choose, suggesting that petrels were not motivated to choose by positional cues in the absence of odour cues. We explored this idea further by performing a homing experiment whereby homing birds had to relocate an artificially displaced burrow entrance. Blue petrels homed, ignoring the natural burrow entrance and using the new artificial one. The ability to smell their own burrow allows blue petrels to return to the colony at night and to find the correct nest.},

	Abstract = {Birds that forage by probing in sand, soil or mud substrates must often use senses other than vision to find their prey. Kiwis (Apterygidae) are nocturnal probing birds inhabiting forested areas in New Zealand. Their visual sense is reduced, but they have a highly developed sense of smell, a bill tip organ similar to that found in Scolopacidae shorebirds, which may be used to detect vibrotactile cues produced by burrowing prey (remote touch), and prominent ear openings. We designed a foraging experiment presenting mealworm prey to eight captive North Island brown kiwis, Apteryx mantelli, under a variety of trial conditions to discover whether they were using hearing, olfaction, remote touch or direct touch (chance alone), singly or together, to find prey. Kiwis were most efficient at finding prey using olfaction alone or in combination with other cues, but switched to locating prey with lower efficiency using remote touch, in the absence of olfactory cues. They did not appear to use auditory cues for foraging. The ability to switch between sensory modalities depending on the quality of the cues available has been documented before in other groups of birds (including thrushes (Turdidae) and sandpipers (Scolopacidae)) and would be of great advantage to wild kiwis foraging under a wide range of environmental conditions.},

While conceptual analyses and empirical research unequivocally stressed the importance of immersion through sensory input, agent-related aspects such as mental beliefs received less attention. We are the first to examine the separate and combined effects of being exposed to the smell of a particular stimulus and/or having a representation of this stimulus in mind. Blood was considered to be interesting to work with, because of widespread folk ideas about its capacity to induce aggression in violent contexts. Using a violent computer game in a between-subjects design, male subjects were tested for the immersive impact of blood, first as an olfactory cue, and second as a mental belief, i.e. the true or false belief that one is smelling `blood'. Lower skin conductance and game scores showed that `blood' served as a distractor hindering the subject's spontaneous engagement. Subjects higher in dispositional aggressiveness, however, got more immersed during the `blood' game rounds, by displaying more combativeness. We discuss our results in light of the undervalued importance of subjective realism in research on presence, and explain the relevance of this work for applications in virtual training in the military and for clinical intervention in combat-related PTSD.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we propose a hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm (HFOA) to solve the hybrid flowshop rescheduling problem with flexible processing time in steelmaking casting systems. First, machine breakdown and processing variation disruptions are considered simultaneously in the rescheduling problem. Second, each solution is represented by a fruit fly with a well-designed solution representation. Third, two novel decoding heuristics considering the problem characteristics, which can significantly improve the solution quality, are developed. Several routing and scheduling neighborhood structures are proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities. Finally, we propose an effective HFOA with well-designed smell and vision search procedures. In addition, an iterated greedy (IG) local search is embedded in the proposed algorithm to further enhance its exploitation ability. The proposed algorithm is tested on sets of instances generated from industrial data. Through comprehensive computational comparisons and statistical analyses, the performance of the proposed HFOA algorithm is favorably compared against several algorithms in terms of both solution quality and efficiency. Note to Practitioners-The steelmaking rescheduling process is critical to the effective operation of iron and steel production. This study models the steelmaking rescheduling problem with flexible processing time as a complex hybrid flowshop in which two types of disruptions, machine breakdown and processing variation, are considered concurrently. A weighted sum of the five objectives, including minimization of the average sojourn time, earliness penalty, tardiness penalty, cast-break penalty, and system instability penalty, is considered in the proposed algorithm. We develop an effective hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm (HFOA) that applies two vectors to represent individuals and presents routing and scheduling neighborhood structures. An IG-based local search procedure is embedded to enhance the exploitation ability of the proposed algorithm. Two decoding heuristics considering the problem characteristics are developed. The effectiveness of the proposed HFOA is demonstrated through comparisons to other well-known and recently developed meta-heuristics. This work can be extended to practical problems by considering other types of disruptions. In addition, the proposed HFOA can also be generalized, and to other hybrid flowshop rescheduling problems.},

Olfactory Receptors (ORs) have a large family of mouse, rat, human, chimpanzee, earthworm, dog, etc. As there are number of families of distinct species, the mouse OR genes are identified to work upon, because restricted amount of work has been done using this species. In this paper, OR family of mouse and human has been studied by using quantification of Barcode matrix, DNA walk and Haar wavelet coefficients. These parameters have been studied for the proper understanding of their DNA sequences, to know the difference between intricate sequences of DNA and to know the hidden symmetries between the DNA sequences. Subsequently, clustering method is applied after knowing the quantitative results. Then a proper study has been done for the clustering results to examine the mouse OR. Using this proposed model, a probable justification or deterministic nullification can be given that whether a given sequence of DNA string composed of nucleotides is a probable mouse OR or not.},

	Abstract = {Desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, navigate individually in the inhospitable saltpans of Tunisia using path integration for long-distance navigation, and visual and olfactory landmarks for fine-scale orientation in the vicinity of the nest entrance. Here, we show in a field experiment that the ants are able to locate the nest entrance within a two-dimensional olfactory array. Ants were trained to forage in an open channel and to memorize the nest entrance relative to four odours that were applied at the corners of an invisible quadratic array. In a test situation, the ants pinpointed the fictive nest only when the odours were present at their learned positions. Our results suggest that the ants had learned the olfactory scenery around their nest. Furthermore, unilaterally antennectomized ants could not pinpoint the nest within a two-dimensional array. Hence, this kind of orientation depends on the simultaneous input of both antennae, that is, on a stereo sense of smell. Until now, insects and mammals, including humans, have only been known to use bilateral sensory input to follow a concentration gradient of an odour. Our evidence suggests that desert ants require a stereo sense of smell to make use of the olfactory scenery around their nest for homing.},

	Abstract = {`Extract Method' is considered one of the most frequently applied and beneficial refactorings, since the corresponding Long Method smell is among the most common and persistent ones. Although Long Method is conceptually related to the implementation of diverse functionalities within a method, until now, this relationship has not been utilized while identifying refactoring opportunities. In this paper we introduce an approach (accompanied by a tool) that aims at identifying source code chunks that collaborate to provide a specific functionality, and propose their extraction as separate methods. The accuracy of the proposed approach has been empirically validated both in an industrial and an open-source setting. In the former case, the approach was capable of identifying functionally related statements within two industrial long methods (approx. 500 LoC each), with a recall rate of 93 percent. In the latter case, based on a comparative study on open-source data, our approach ranks better compared to two well-known techniques of the literature. To assist software engineers in the prioritization of the suggested refactoring opportunities the approach ranks them based on an estimate of their fitness for extraction. The provided ranking has been validated in both settings and proved to be strongly correlated with experts' opinion.},

	Abstract = {Empirically derived semantic feature norms categorized into different types of knowledge (e.g., visual, functional, auditory) can be summed to create number-of-feature counts per knowledge type. Initial evidence suggests several such knowledge types may be recruited during language comprehension. The present study provides a more detailed understanding of the timecourse and intensity of influence of several such knowledge types on real-time neural activity. A linear mixed-effects model was applied to single trial event-related potentials for 207 visually presented concrete words measured on total number of features (semantic richness), imageability, and number of visual motion, color, visual form, smell, taste, sound, and function features. Significant influences of multiple feature types occurred before 200ms, suggesting parallel neural computation of word form and conceptual knowledge during language comprehension. Function and visual motion features most prominently influenced neural activity, underscoring the importance of action-related knowledge in computing word meaning. The dynamic time courses and topographies of these effects are most consistent with a flexible conceptual system wherein temporally dynamic recruitment of representations in modal and supramodal cortex are a crucial element of the constellation of processes constituting word meaning computation in the brain.},

	Abstract = {If residents' perceptions, concerns and attitudes towards waste management facilities are either not well understood or underestimated, people can produce strong opposition that may include protest demonstrations and violent conflicts such as those experienced in the Campania Region of Italy. The aim of this study was to verify the effects of the closure of solid waste treatment and disposal facilities (two landfills and one RDF production plant) on public perception of odour and environmental pollution. The study took place in four villages in Southern Italy. Identical questionnaires were administered to residents during 2003 and after the closure of the facilities occurred in 2008. The residents' perception of odour nuisance considerably diminished between 2003 and 2009 for the nearest villages, with odour perception showing an association with distance from the facilities. Post closure, residents had difficulty in identifying the type of smell due to the decrease in odour level. During both surveys, older residents reported most concern about the potentially adverse health impacts of long-term exposure to odours from MSW facilities. However, although awareness of MSW facilities and concern about potentially adverse health impacts varied according to the characteristics of residents in 2003, substantial media coverage produced an equalisation effect and increased knowledge about the type of facilities and how they operated. It is possible that residents of the village nearest to the facilities reported lower awareness of and concern about odour and environmental pollution because the municipality received economic compensation for their presence.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores the use of design patterns and anti-patterns in teaching human--computer interaction principles. Patterns are increasingly popular and are seen as an efficient knowledge transfer mechanism in many fields, including software development in the field of software engineering, and more recently in the field of human--computer interaction. In software engineering a concerted effort is also being made to identify and document anti-patterns for recording the experiences of expert software developers to caution novices against potential bad practices. It is, however, essential that we ensure compatibility with the learner's internal knowledge representation and acquisition processes, whether we are attempting to convey the knowledge in the form of a pattern or an anti-pattern. Since teaching with anti-patterns implies using negation, the primary aim of the research reported in this paper is to explore the efficacy of negative, rather than positive, teaching mechanisms. Evidence from theories of mental modelling and knowledge acquisition that highlight significant dangers in the use of anti-patterns to teach novices human--computer interaction principles is presented and supported with empirical findings. We started off by investigating the use of patterns (positive) in teaching, and then carried out experiments to test the use of anti-patterns (negative) in teaching HCI principles. This paper, whilst reporting mainly on our findings with respect to HCI design anti-patterns, will also identify some problems with the structure and use of patterns and anti-patterns in pedagogy.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of the Porewater Chemistry (PC) experiment at the Mont Terri (MT) Underground Rock Laboratory (URL) was to measure geochemical parameters, such as pH, Eh and pCO2, in the porewater of the Opalinus Clay formation. Although the PC experiment was designed and implemented carefully from a geochemical perspective, conditions were not sterile and some microbial and nutrient contamination likely occurred. Microbial activity in the added synthetic porewater in the borehole was apparent shortly after initiation of the experiment and affected the geochemical parameters observed in the porewater. This paper summarizes the results from microbial analyses of post-termination PC water and overcore clay samples, conducted to attempt to elucidate the role of microbial activity in the evolution of the geochemical conditions in the PC experiment. Microbial analyses of the PC borehole water, and of clay overcore samples from around the borehole, were carried out at three laboratories and included both molecular biology and culturing methods. Results indicated the presence of heterotrophic aerobic and anaerobic organisms that resulted likely from the initial, non-sterile conditions, sustained by suspected contamination with organic matter (glycerol, acetone). The results also indicated the presence of NO3-reducers, Fe-reducers, SO4-reducers and methanogens (i.e., Bacteria as well as Archaea), suggesting a reducing environment with Fe(III)- and SO4 reduction, and methanogenesis occurring in the PC water and adjacent clay. A black precipitate containing pyrite (identified by XRD and SEM) and a strong H2S smell in the porewater confirmed the occurrence of SO4 reduction. Microorganisms identified in the porewater included Pseudomonas stutzeri, Bacillus licheniformis, Desulfosporosinus spp. and Hyphomonas spp. Species identified in enrichment cultures from the overcore samples included Pseudomonas stutzeri, three species of Trichococcus spp., Caldanaerocella colombiensis, Geosporobacter subterrenus and Desulfosporosinus lacus. Overall the results indicated a thriving microbial community in the PC water and adjacent clay in contrast to ``undisturbed'' Opalinus Clay for which limited evidence for a small viable microbial community has been given in a previous study.},

	Abstract = {Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is a new paradigm that replaces the traditional way to develop distributed software with a combination of discovery, engagement and reuse of third-party services. Web Service technologies are currently the most adopted alternative for implementing the SOC paradigm. However, Web Service discovery presents many challenges that, in the end, hinder service reuse. This paper reports frequent practices present in a body of public services that attempt to prevent the discovery of any service. In addition, we have studied how to solve the discoverability problems that these bad practices cause. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel catalog of eight Web Service discoverability anti-patterns. We conducted a comparative analysis of the retrieval effectiveness of three discovery systems by using the original body of Web Services versus their corrected version. This experiment shows that the removal of the identified anti-patterns eases the discovery process by allowing the employed discovery systems to rank more relevant services before non-relevant ones, with the same queries. Moreover, we conducted a survey to collect the opinions from 26 individuals about whether the improved descriptions are more intelligible than the original ones. This experiment provides more evidence of the importance of correcting the observed problems.},

	Abstract = {Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) provides developers a conceptual abstraction for mapping the application code to the underlying databases. ORM is widely used in industry due to its convenience; permitting developers to focus on developing the business logic without worrying too much about the database access details. However, developers often write ORM code without considering the impact of such code on database performance, leading to cause transactions with timeouts or hangs in large-scale systems. Unfortunately, there is little support to help developers automatically detect suboptimal database accesses. In this paper, we propose an automated framework to detect ORM performance anti-patterns. Our framework automatically flags performance anti-patterns in the source code. Furthermore, as there could be hundreds or even thousands of instances of anti-patterns, our framework provides sup- port to prioritize performance bug fixes based on a statistically rigorous performance assessment. We have successfully evaluated our framework on two open source and one large-scale industrial systems. Our case studies show that our framework can detect new and known real-world performance bugs and that fixing the detected performance anti- patterns can improve the system response time by up to 98%.},

	Abstract = {The objectives were to evaluate the attitude of butcher and consumer towards soft and pasty texture problems in dry-cured ham and to assess the butcher and consumer behaviour when selecting and purchasing this product. Ninety-nine butchers and 200 consumers were interviewed with 17-question and 20-question surveys, respectively. The texture problems (softness and pastiness) were highly important for both butchers and consumers. The characteristics most frequently considered ``important'' or ``very important'' by butchers were processing time, smell/aroma and texture as selection criteria and salty taste and aged/matured flavour as sensory indicators of dry-cured ham quality. According to butchers' opinion, salty taste and their own advice are the factors most frequently considered ``important'' or ``very important'' as affecting the consumer's decision to purchase. For the consumer, the sensory attributes were considered more important than extrinsic characteristics when purchasing dry-cured ham.},

Acylglycerol synthesis was performed using Lipozyme Novo 435 under different reaction conditions according to the experiment design. Five factors were chosen to optimise the process parameters of lipase-catalysed synthesis. The results indicated that the esterification degree was above 90% under the following conditions: glycerol -- 2.5g, hexane -- 5ml, the initial water content -- 0.60%, temperature -- 40$\,^{\circ}$C, and molecular sieves -- 1g. The product was a bright orange and transparent liquid, with no fishlike smell and high mobility. The contents of DHA and EPA were 73.4% and 13.5%, respectively. The reaction product was composed of monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols, the contents of which were 12.1%, 56.1% and 31.3%, respectively.},

Due to multiple processes and overlapped activities, process mapping plays a significant role in building the model. The model replicates a non-terminating welding fabrication system with duplicate stochastic events caused by system failures and delays. A full factorial model is employed and analyzed to examine the main and interaction effects of five major types of system failures and delays via multiple regression analysis. The analysis derived from the full factorial model shows that material handling carrier delays have the most significant impact on the cycle time. This case study illustrates a modeling approach with system verification and validation revealing fundamental system design flaws which cause a significant loss of production.},

	Abstract = {At the moment, smell sensors for odor source localization in mobile robotics represent a topic of interest for researchers around the world. In particular, we introduce in this paper the idea of developing biologically inspired sniffing robots in combination with bioinspired techniques such as evolutionary computing. The aim is to approach the problem of creating an artificial nose that can be incorporated into a real working system, while considering the environmental model and odor behavior, the perception system, and algorithm for tracking the odor plume. Current algorithms try to emulate animal behavior in an attempt to replicate their capability to follow odors. Nevertheless, odor perception systems are still in their infancy and far from their biological counterpart. This paper presents a proposal in which a real-working artificial nose is tested as a perception system within a mobile robot. Genetic programming is used as the learning technique platform to develop odor source localization algorithms. Experiments in simulation and with an actual working robot are presented and the results compared with two algorithms. The quality of results demonstrates that genetic programming is able to recreate chemotaxis behavior by considering mathematical models for odor propagation and perception system.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Background & aims
The effect of human milk storage in the refrigerator has been investigated with regard to sensory changes and modifications to the molecular composition of the milk odour-active volatiles.
Methods
In the present study, characteristic odorants from fat oxidation, known from previous studies, as well as free fatty acids were quantified as representative marker substances by means of stable isotope dilution assays of fresh milk samples and milk samples stored at +4 $\,^{\circ}$C for one and three days, respectively.
Results
Sensory evaluation showed that rancid and sweaty odour attributes were generated during storage, resulting in an unpleasant aroma profile for adults; however, odour changes were not as pronounced as those observed in our previous study for freeze storage. Fatty and buttery odour notes and a cooked milk-like smell were also generated. In total eight odorants from fat oxidation were determined and some potent odorants showed slight concentration increases. Moreover, five free fatty acids were determined and these all showed drastic concentration increases, even after storage for just one day.
Conclusions
These investigations support our previous findings that storage recommendations for breast milk might need to be slightly reconsidered in view of potential sensory changes; on the other hand, no negative physiological effects are to be expected from these changes.},

	Abstract = {In two experiments, hungry rats, Rattus norvegicus, were present in one side of an operant chamber while a conspecific demonstrator in the adjacent compartment moved a single lever either up or down for a food reward. During a subsequent test session, in which these rats were allowed access to the lever for the first time, all responses were rewarded regardless of their direction. In experiment 1, rats that were prevented from observing the direction of lever movement by means of a screen showed a reliable demonstrator-consistent response bias, while rats that had observed the direction of lever movement and in addition had access to any odour cues deposited on the lever did not. In experiment 2, each rat observed another rat (the `viewed' demonstrator) moving a lever either up or down. They were then transferred into the test compartment of a different operant chamber in which another rat (the `box' demonstrator) had moved the lever in the same direction as the viewed demonstrator or in the opposite direction. These observer rats showed a reliable preference for their box demonstrator's direction, but responded in the opposite direction to their viewed demonstrator. Taken together, the results of these experiments suggest that directional responding by rats in a vertical movement two-action test is influenced by demonstrator-deposited odour cues in addition to visual experience of a demonstrator's behaviour. Furthermore, while odour-mediated local enhancement gave rise to demonstrator-consistent responding, visual observation of a conspecific appeared to have the reverse effect.

	Abstract = {We explored the ability of infants to recognize the smell of daily foods, including strawberries and tomatoes, by using a preferential-looking-technique. Experiment 1 was conducted while strawberries were in season (from March to June) in order to enhance the frequency of participant exposure to strawberries outside of the laboratory. Thirty-seven infants aged 6--8months were tested with a stimulus composed of a pair of photos of strawberries and tomatoes placed side by side and accompanied by a strawberry odor, a tomato odor, or no odors. Infants showed a preference for the strawberry picture when they smelled the congruent odor, but no such preference for the tomato picture. These results suggest that even young infants can recognize olfactory--visual congruency. We conducted Experiment 2 while strawberries were out of season (from July to September) to reduce participant exposure to strawberries in their daily life. Twenty-six infants aged 6--8months were tested with a stimulus composed of a pair of photos of strawberries and tomatoes placed side by side and accompanied by a strawberry odor, or no odors. In Experiment 2, the olfactory--visual binding effect disappeared. This implies that visual--olfactory binding is triggered by an observer's experience.},

A fundamental difficulty in this process is that developers are only equipped with static analysis techniques for the source code, which do not exploit traceable architectural information. This work addresses this problem by: (1) identifying a family of architecturally-relevant code smells; (2) providing empirical evidence about the correlation of code smell patterns and architectural degeneration; (3) proposing a set of metrics and detection strategies and that exploit traceable architectural information in smell detection; and (4) conceiving a technique to support the early identification of architecture degeneration symptoms by reasoning about code smell patterns.},

	Abstract = {Goal: During mechanical ventilation, patient-ventilator disharmony is frequently observed and may result in increased breathing effort, compromising the patient's comfort and recovery. This circumstance requires clinical intervention and becomes challenging when verbal communication is difficult. In this study, we propose a brain-computer interface (BCI) to automatically and noninvasively detect patient-ventilator disharmony from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals: a brain-ventilator interface (BVI). Methods: Our framework exploits the cortical activation provoked by the inspiratory compensation when the subject and the ventilator are desynchronized. Use of a one-class approach and Riemannian geometry of EEG covariance matrices allows effective classification of respiratory states. The BVI is validated on nine healthy subjects that performed different respiratory tasks that mimic a patient-ventilator disharmony. Results: Classification performances, in terms of areas under receiver operating characteristic curves, are significantly improved using EEG signals compared to detection based on air flow. Reduction in the number of electrodes that can achieve discrimination can be often desirable (e.g., for portable BCI systems). By using an iterative channel selection technique, the common highest order ranking, we find that a reduced set of electrodes (n = 6) can slightly improve for an intrasubject configuration, and it still provides fairly good performances for a general intersubject setting. Conclusion: Results support the discriminant capacity of our approach to identify anomalous respiratory states, by learning from a training set containing only normal respiratory epochs. Significance: The proposed framework opens the door to BVIs for monitoring patient's breathing comfort and adapting ventilator parameters to patient respiratory needs.},

	Abstract = {Similar to the concept of a cocktail or mocktail, we present Vocktail (a.k.a. Virtual Cocktail) - an interactive drinking utensil that digitally simulates multisensory flavor experiences. The Vocktail system utilizes three common sensory modalities, taste, smell, and visual (color), to create virtual flavors and augment the existing flavors of a beverage. The system is coupled with a mobile application that enables users to create customized virtual flavor sensations by configuring each of the stimuli via Bluetooth. The system consists of a cocktail glass that is seamlessly fused into a 3D printed structure, which holds the electronic control module, three scent cartridges, and three micro air-pumps. When a user drinks from the system, the visual (RGB light projected on the beverage), taste (electrical stimulation at the tip of the tongue), and smell stimuli (emitted by micro air-pumps) are combined to create a virtual flavor sensation, thus altering the flavor of the beverage. In summary, this paper discusses 1) technical details of the Vocktail system and 2) user experiments that investigate the influences of these multimodal stimuli on the perception of virtual flavors in terms of five primary tastes (i.e. salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami). Our results suggest that the combination of these stimuli delivers richer flavor experiences, as compared to separately simulating individual modalities, and indicates that the types of pairings that can be formed between smell and electric taste stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Parental care is a common strategy among vertebrates to ensure successful reproduction. Anuran amphibians have evolved a remarkable diversity of reproductive methods including advanced levels of parental care. Among the most derived strategies are those of the Neotropical poison frogs (Dendrobatidae). These amphibians exhibit a wide array of behavioural traits such as egg guarding, larval transport by parental frogs and larval feeding with trophic (unfertilized) eggs. Ranitomeya variabilis from the upper Amazon basin in Peru deposits both eggs and tadpoles in phytotelmata. The exploitation of these small pools is advantageous as it lowers the risk of predation, but it is more costly because of limited resource availability. Additionally, poison frog larvae are often cannibalistic, so the identification and avoidance of conspecifics represents an adaptive behaviour for these amphibians. While studies have shown that poison frogs actively avoid depositing with conspecifics, the mechanism for assessing pool quality remains unknown. In field experiments, we found that parental R. variabilis frogs used chemical cues to recognize the presence of tadpoles in phytotelmata. Furthermore, they distinguished between cannibalistic and noncannibalistic tadpoles, a behaviour that supports the survival of their own offspring.},

	Abstract = {Terminal equipment like personal computers (PCs) and mobile phones are mainstream devices in the Information Society. Most means for stimulating active communications depend on visual information. To classify human sensations, the phrase of "five senses" consisting of vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, has been used from olden days. This classification is triggered by the ancient Greeks. However, there are at least nine types or over twenty types of human sensory channels if the classification is considered from a practical standpoint. In the case of touch sensation, it tells the brain not only simple skin sensations, pain, and temperature, but also a variety of sensations such as pressure and vibration. As you can easily experience when you browse web pages on the Internet, the current web technology enables the visualization of their contents, it does not provide any means to convey other sensory information.

	Abstract = {Code anomalies are structural problems in the program. Even though they might represent symptoms of architecture degradation, several code anomalies do not contribute to this process. Source code inspection by developers might not support time-effective detection of architecturally-relevant anomalies in a program. Hence, they usually rely on multiple software metrics known to effectively detect code anomalies. However, there is still no empirical knowledge about the time effectiveness of metric-based strategies to detect architecturally-relevant anomalies. Given the longitudinal nature of this activity, we performed a first exploratory case study to address this gap. We compare metrics-based strategies with manual inspections made by the actual software developers. The study was conducted in the context of a legacy software system with 30K lines of code, 415 architectural elements, 210 versions, and embracing reengineering effort for almost 3 years. Effectiveness was assessed in terms of several quantitative and qualitative indicators. To measure the effort, we computed the amount of time used in several activities required to identify architecturally-relevant code anomalies. The results of our study shed light on potential effort reduction and effectiveness improvements of metrics-based strategies.},

Access controls typically check privileges that capture the semantics of the operations they protect. Semantic smells and errors in access control models stem from privileges that are partially or totally unrelated to the action they protect. This paper presents a novel approach, partly based on static analysis and information retrieval techniques, for the automatic detection of semantic smells and errors in access control models. Investigation of the case study application revealed 31 smells and 2 errors. Errors were reported to developers who quickly confirmed their relevance and took actions to correct them.

	Abstract = {Fluency -- the ease with which people process information -- is a central piece of information we take into account when we make judgments about the world. Prior research has shown that fluency affects judgments in a wide variety of domains, including frequency, familiarity, and confidence. In this paper, we present evidence that fluency also plays a role in categorization judgments. In Experiment 1, participants judged a variety of different exemplars to be worse category members if they were less fluent (because they were presented in a smaller typeface). In Experiment 2, we found that fluency also affected judgments of feature typicality. In Experiment 3, we demonstrated that the effects of fluency can be reversed when a salient attribution for reduced fluency is available (i.e., the stimuli are hard to read because they were printed by a printer with low toner). In Experiment 4 we replicated these effects using a within-subject design, which ruled out the possibility that the effects were a statistical artifact caused by aggregation of data. We propose a possible mechanism for these effects: if an exemplar and its category are closely related, activation of one will cause priming of the other, leading to increased fluency. Over time, feelings of fluency come to be used as a valid cue that can become confused with more traditional sources of information about category membership.},

Several industrial studies have shown that compliance management is a daunting task, and organizations are still struggling and spending billions of dollars annually to ensure and prove their compliance. Theoretically, design-time compliance checking could provide a preliminary assurance that corresponding running instances would be compliant to relevant laws and regulations; however, due to the existence of human and machine related errors and the absence of necessary contextual information during design-time, runtime compliance monitoring becomes a must. In this paper, we present a generic proactive runtime Business Process (BP) compliance monitoring framework:BP-MaaS, which incorporates a wide range of expressive high-level compliance patterns for the abstract specification of runtime constraints. Compliance monitoring is achieved by means of anti-patterns, a novel evaluation approach that is independent of any underlying technology and could be applied to the checking of compliance in the different phases of the BP lifecycle. As a proof-of-concept, complex event processing (CEP) technology is adopted as one of the possible realizations of the framework.},

However, the existing clone detectors have one or more of the three shortcomings: (a) limitation in detecting Type-3 clones, (b) they come as stand-alone tools separate from IDE and thus cannot support clone-aware development, (c) they overwhelm the developer with all clones from the entire code-base, instead of a focused search for clones of a selected code segment of the developer's interest.
This paper presents our IDE-integrated clone search tool, that addresses all the above issues. For clone detection, we adapt a suffix-tree-based hybrid algorithm. Through an asymptotic analysis, we show that our approach for clone detection is both time and memory efficient. Moreover, using three separate empirical studies, we demonstrate that our tool is flexibly usable for searching exact (Type-1) and near-miss (Type-2 and Type-3) clones with high precision and recall.},

	Abstract = {The redistribution of class responsibilities is a common reengineering practice in object-oriented (OO) software evolution. During the redistribution, developers frequently construct batched refactoring plans for moving multiple methods and fields among various classes. With an objective of carefully maintaining the cohesion and coupling degree of the class design, executing a batched refactoring plan without introducing any objective-violating side effect into the refactored code is essential. However, using most refactoring engines for batched refactoring plan execution introduces coupling-increasing Middle Man bad smell in the final refactored code and therefore makes the refactoring execution suboptimal in achieving the redistribution objective. This work proposes Obey, a methodology for optimal batched refactoring plan execution. Obey analyzes a batched refactoring plan, identifies Middle Man symptoms that cause suboptimal execution, and renovates the plan for optimal execution. We have conducted an empirical study on three open-source software projects to confirm the effectiveness of Obey in a practical context.},

	Abstract = {Background
Guanine quadruplexes (GQs) play vital roles in many cellular processes and are of much interest as drug targets. In contrast to the availability of many structural studies, there is still limited knowledge on GQ folding.
Scope of review
We review recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of the folding of GQs, with an emphasis paid to the human telomeric DNA GQ. We explain the basic principles and limitations of all types of MD methods used to study unfolding and folding in a way accessible to non-specialists. We discuss the potential role of G-hairpin, G-triplex and alternative GQ intermediates in the folding process. We argue that, in general, folding of GQs is fundamentally different from funneled folding of small fast-folding proteins, and can be best described by a kinetic partitioning (KP) mechanism. KP is a competition between at least two (but often many) well-separated and structurally different conformational ensembles.
Major conclusions
The KP mechanism is the only plausible way to explain experiments reporting long time-scales of GQ folding and the existence of long-lived sub-states. A significant part of the natural partitioning of the free energy landscape of GQs comes from the ability of the GQ-forming sequences to populate a large number of syn-anti patterns in their G-tracts. The extreme complexity of the KP of GQs typically prevents an appropriate description of the folding landscape using just a few order parameters or collective variables.
General significance
We reconcile available computational and experimental studies of GQ folding and formulate basic principles characterizing GQ folding landscapes. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled G-quadruplex Guest Editor: Dr. Concetta Giancola and Dr. Daniela Montesarchio.},

The results indicate that there are four causes of channel conflict: goal divergence, roles unclarity, expectations divergence and relationship disharmony.

	Abstract = {There is a growing need for scalable search-based software engineering approaches that address software engineering problems where a large number of objectives are to be optimized. Software refactoring is one of these problems where a refactoring sequence is sought that optimizes several software metrics. Most of the existing refactoring work uses a large set of quality metrics to evaluate the software design after applying refactoring operations, but current search-based software engineering approaches are limited to using a maximum of five metrics. We propose for the first time a scalable search-based software engineering approach based on a newly proposed evolutionary optimization method NSGA-III where there are 15 different objectives to be optimized. In our approach, automated refactoring solutions are evaluated using a set of 15 distinct quality metrics. We evaluated this approach on seven large open source systems and found that, on average, more than 92% of code smells were corrected. Statistical analysis of our experiments over 31 runs shows that NSGA-III performed significantly better than two other many-objective techniques (IBEA and MOEA/D), a multi-objective algorithm (NSGA-II) and two mono-objective approaches, hence demonstrating that our NSGA-III approach represents the new state of the art in fully-automated refactoring.},

	Abstract = {Some Japanese language students have suggested that Japanese conversation tends to have periods of silence. However, empirical research regarding this tendency has rarely been done. The present study takes a glimpse at the occurrence of silence in the sequence of backchannels, known as the loop sequence, and shows that silence is not interactionally vacuous in this context of Japanese conversation. The data in the present study consist of four audio- and video-recorded dyadic conversations in which the participants were given a theme to discuss. An analysis of visualized data reveals that nods, produced independently and without any vocals, frequently occur during the loop sequence. It also indicates that creating silence in which no talk-relevant activities are conducted is avoided as much as possible during the loop sequence. The participants fill in a loop sequence silence with reciprocal or simultaneous verbal backchannels, nods, or smiles. As a result, a cooperative atmosphere is maintained during the loop sequence. Floor negotiation during the loop sequence is an enterprise by which Japanese conversationalists take advantage of both verbal and nonverbal channels so that they can continue the current dialogue without causing disharmony.},

	Abstract = {Context
Security vulnerabilities discovered later in the development cycle are more expensive to fix than those discovered early. Therefore, software developers should strive to discover vulnerabilities as early as possible. Unfortunately, the large size of code bases and lack of developer expertise can make discovering software vulnerabilities difficult. A number of vulnerability discovery techniques are available, each with their own strengths.
Objective
The objective of this research is to aid in the selection of vulnerability discovery techniques by comparing the vulnerabilities detected by each and comparing their efficiencies.
Method
We conducted three case studies using three electronic health record systems to compare four vulnerability discovery techniques: exploratory manual penetration testing, systematic manual penetration testing, automated penetration testing, and automated static analysis.
Results
In our case study, we found empirical evidence that no single technique discovered every type of vulnerability. We discovered that the specific set of vulnerabilities identified by one tool was largely orthogonal to that of other tools. Systematic manual penetration testing found the most design flaws, while automated static analysis found the most implementation bugs. The most efficient discovery technique in terms of vulnerabilities discovered per hour was automated penetration testing.
Conclusion
The results show that employing a single technique for vulnerability discovery is insufficient for finding all types of vulnerabilities. Each technique identified only a subset of the vulnerabilities, which, for the most part were independent of each other. Our results suggest that in order to discover the greatest variety of vulnerability types, at least systematic manual penetration testing and automated static analysis should be performed.},

	Abstract = {While the physiological response of humans to emotional events or stimuli is well-investigated for many modalities (like EEG, skin resistance, ...), surprisingly little is known about the exhalation of so-called Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) at quite low concentrations in response to such stimuli. VOCs are molecules of relatively small mass that quickly evaporate or sublimate and can be detected in the air that surrounds us. The paper introduces a new field of application for data mining, where trace gas responses of people reacting on-line to films shown in cinemas (or movie theaters) are related to the semantic content of the films themselves. To do so, we measured the VOCs from a movie theater over a whole month in intervals of thirty seconds, and annotated the screened films by a controlled vocabulary compiled from multiple sources. To gain a better understanding of the data and to reveal unknown relationships, we have built prediction models for so-called forward prediction (the prediction of future VOCs from the past), backward prediction (the prediction of past scene labels from future VOCs), which is some form of abductive reasoning, and Granger causality. Experimental results show that some VOCs and some labels can be predicted with relatively low error, and that hint for causality with low p-values can be detected in the data. The data set is publicly available at: },

	Abstract = {Information that can be gained using smell, one of the five senses, has a deep connection with memory and affect, therefore, presentation of scents with videos has an effect that enhances realistic sensations. In current videos with scents, it is often the case that a great deal of scent is emitted at the same time in one scene, and there is no change of scent in subsequent scenes. In this study, we researched how humans react when the scent switches between video scenes. We focused especially on how visual information affects the reaction speed. Through this experiment, we found that reaction time was shorter when the scent changed after converting scenes. In addition, we found that the content of the videos did not have an effect on the reaction times. Therefore, when adding scents, it is best to switch the scent after the scene changes. We hope that this finding about responses toward scent changes assists in designing presentations that use scents.},

We demonstrate that (1) the Popa-Zeldovich model for MKSE does not imply security against either passive or active attacks; (2) Mylar-based Web applications reveal users' data and queries to passive and active adversarial servers; and (3) Mylar is generically insecure against active attacks due to system design flaws. Our results show that the problem of securing client-server applications against actively malicious servers is challenging and still unsolved.

	Abstract = {Single sign-on (SSO) systems, such as OpenID and OAuth, allow web sites, so-called relying parties (RPs), to delegate user authentication to identity providers (IdPs), such as Facebook or Google. These systems are very popular, as they provide a convenient means for users to log in at RPs and move much of the burden of user authentication from RPs to IdPs. There is, however, a downside to current systems, as they do not respect users' privacy: IdPs learn at which RP a user logs in. With one exception, namely Mozilla's BrowserID system (a.k.a. Mozilla Persona), current SSO systems were not even designed with user privacy in mind. Unfortunately, recently discovered attacks, which exploit design flaws of BrowserID, show that BrowserID does not provide user privacy either.
In this paper, we therefore propose the first privacy-respecting SSO system for the web, called SPRESSO (for Secure Privacy-REspecting Single Sign-On). The system is easy to use, decentralized, and platform independent. It is based solely on standard HTML5 and web features and uses no browser extensions, plug-ins, or other executables.
Existing SSO systems and the numerous attacks on such systems illustrate that the design of secure SSO systems is highly non-trivial. We therefore also carry out a formal analysis of SPRESSO based on an expressive model of the web in order to formally prove that SPRESSO enjoys strong authentication and privacy properties.},

Previous research emphasises the relevance of experiences created by the technology in the users arguing that the emotions should be taken into account during early design stages and made part of the design itself. In this paper we provide a step-by-step production pipeline on how to make your own design fiction film, and how you can get the experiences across. For this purpose we focus on the experiences and emotions that a specific interaction medium elicits. We gained inspiration from the increased exploration of olfactory experiences in HCI. We used a classification of smell experiences as a starting point to produce a design fiction film for the automotive context, not limited by technology but inspired by experiences.},

The focus of the research presented in this paper is on olfactory enhanced multimedia, which concerns itself with associating computer generated smell with other media. However, the lingering nature of smell, as opposed to the transitory nature of other media objects that multimedia applications are accustomed to, such as video and audio, means that specific attention needs to be given when synchronising other media content with olfactory data. Results highlight the existence of two perceptual synchronisation regions for olfactory enhanced-multimedia applications.

Exploring past maintenance and development history can be an effective way of finding refactoring opportunities. Code elements which undergo changes in the past, at approximately the same time, bear a good probability for being semantically related. Moreover, these elements that experienced a huge number of refactoring in the past have a good chance for refactoring in the future. In addition, the development history can be used to propose new refactoring solutions in similar contexts. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization-based approach to find the best sequence of refactorings that minimizes the number of bad-smells, and maximizes the use of development history and semantic coherence. To this end, we use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to find the best trade-off between these three objectives.

	Abstract = {Background: Software repositories provide large amount of data encompassing software changes throughout its evolution. Those repositories can be effectively used to extract and analyze pertinent information and derive conclusions related to the software history or its current snapshot. Objective: This work aims to investigate recent studies on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) approaches collecting evidences about software analysis goals (purpose, focus, and object of analysis), data sources, evaluation methods, tools, and how the area is evolving. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed to identify and analyze research on mining software repositories by analyzing five editions of Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories -- the main conference on this area. Results: MSR approaches have been used for many different goals, mainly for comprehension of defects, analysis of the contribution and behavior of developers, and software evolution comprehension. Besides, some gaps were identified with respect to their goals, focus, and data source type (e.g. lack of usage of comments to identify smells, refactoring, and issues of software quality). Regarding the evaluation method, our analysis pointed out to an extensive usage of some types of empirical evaluation. Conclusion: Studies of the MSR have focused on different goals, however there are still many research opportunities to be explored and issues associated with MSR that should be considered.},

	Abstract = {Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the sixth most common chronic illness worldwide, which has a significant impact on patients' quality of life. The actual cost of AR is staggering, approximately $5.6 billion being spent annually in direct medical costs and other indirect costs. Therefore, it should be taken seriously upon its evaluation and treatment. AR is an IgE-mediated inflammation, which symptoms are likely due to increased vascular permeability. Current therapeutic options such as avoidance of allergen, medication and immunotherapy are unsatisfactory. Far-infrared (FIR) is an invisible electromagnetic wave with a wavelength longer than that of visible light. It has been used to treat vascular diseases as a result of an increase in blood flow. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects of FIR therapy in patients with AR. Thirty-one patients with AR were enrolled in this study. A WS TY101 FIR emitter was placed to face the patient's nasal region at a distance of 30 cm. The treatment was performed for 40 min every morning for 7 days. Every day, patients recorded their symptoms in a diary before and during treatment. Each symptom of rhinitis was rated on a 4-point scale (0-3) according to severity. During the period of FIR therapy, the symptoms of eye itching, nasal itching, nasal stuffiness, rhinorrhea and sneezing were all significantly improved. Smell impairment was not improved until after the last treatment. No obvious adverse effect was observed in the patients during treatment and follow-up. We concluded that FIR therapy could improve the symptoms of AR and might serve as a novel treatment modality for AR.},

Our results show that a high number of uncaught runtime exceptions and subsumption handlers were applied in some libraries.

Introduction
A clear set of guidelines has not been defined in the use of antibiotics in penile prosthesis implantation.
Aim
We surveyed urologists throughout the United States to determine current practice patterns regarding antibiotic use in primary and revision penile prosthesis surgery.
Methods
Fifty-two Sexual Medicine Society of North America (SMS) member urologist and 164 non-SMS member urologist responses were obtained.
Main Outcome Measures
The survey contained 10 questions regarding antibiotic selection for primary and revision inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) implantation.
Results
One hundred percent of responders in both groups utilize intraoperative antibiotics, most commonly vancomycin and gentamicin in both groups. Of SMS members, 94% prescribed postoperative home oral antibiotics in contrast to 88% of non-SMS members (P=0.3). Among SMS members, the most common antibiotic prescribed postoperatively was levofloxacin 500mg daily while among non-SMS members, the most common antibiotic postoperatively was cephalexin 500mg 2--4 times daily. Of SMS members, antibiotic irrigation intraoperatively occurred with 100% and with 92% of non-SMS members (P=0.04). Thirty-seven percent SMS physicians and 15% non-SMS physicians made modifications of intraoperative and postoperative antibiotics for high-risk patients (P=0.001). In the circumstance of revision of a clinically noninfected IPP, 23% SMS and 16% non-SMS member physicians utilized additional antibiotics/treatment (P=0.3). Sixteen of those surveyed admitted that they had been approached by their institution about their antibiotic use and asked to change. In the past 5 years, 29% surveyed have changed their practice patterns in antibiotic use.
Conclusions
There is significant difference between practice patterns of SMS and non-SMS urologists in terms of antibiotic irrigation usage, modifications for high-risk patients, and consensus about the importance of antibiotic use with Coloplast Titan implant (Coloplast, Minneapolis, MN, USA). A significant lack of uniformity exists among urologists performing prosthetic surgery with regard to antibiotic protocols. A standard set of guidelines may prove useful to implanters.

	Abstract = {Complicated control systems are used in many safety-critical applications, such as in cars and airplanes. Due to the nature of these systems, verification can be very difficult to do analytically or algorithmically. The only feasible analysis and verification method is often simulation. The generation of good test cases that can expose flaws in the controller design is therefore of great importance. In this paper we investigate the use of optimisation methods for finding such test cases automatically. For this purpose we give a language to express assertions in control systems, as well as a translation of the assertions to a form suitable for optimisation. We also discuss different ways to generate the input signals for the systems to maximise performance of the optimisation. To evaluate if optimisation is a feasible approach, we provide a case study demonstrating that optimisation methods are beneficial for investigating properties of control system designs},

	Abstract = {The literature describes several approaches to identify the artefacts of programs that evolve together to reveal the (hidden) dependencies among these artefacts and to infer and describe their evolution trends. We propose the use of biological methods to group artefacts, to detect co-evolution among them, and to construct their phylogenic trees to express their evolution trends. First, we introduced the novel concepts of macro co-changes (MCCs), i.e., of artefacts that co-change within a large time interval and of dephase macro co-changes (DMCCs), i.e., macro co-changes that always happen with the same shifts in time. We developped an approach, Macocha, to identify these new patterns of artefacts co-evolution in large programs. Now, we are analysing the evolution of classes playing roles in design pattern and--or anti-patterns. In parallel to previous work, we are detecting what classes are in macro co-change or in dephase macro co-change with the design motifs. Results trend to show that classes plying roles in design motifs have specifics evolution trends. Finally, we are implementing an approach, Profilo, to achieve the analysis of the evolution of artefacts and versions of large object-oriented programs. Profilo create a phylogenic tree of different versions of program that describes versions evolution and the relation among versions and programs. We will also evaluate the usefulness of our tools using lab and field studies.},

	Abstract = {Objective
To compare a seal-in liner with the common suction socket with regards to patient satisfaction and problems experienced with the prosthesis.
Design
Retrospective survey.
Setting
A medical and engineering research center and a department of biomechanical engineering.
Participants
Men (N=90) with traumatic transfemoral amputation who used both suspension systems participated in the study.
Intervention
Two prosthetic suspension systems: a seal-in liner and common suction socket.
Main Outcome Measures
Two questionnaires were completed by each subject to evaluate their satisfaction and problems experienced with the 2 suspension systems. Satisfaction and problems with the prosthetic suspension systems were analyzed in terms of fitting, donning and doffing, sitting, walking, stair negotiation, appearance, sweating, wounds, pain, irritation, pistoning, edema, smell, sound, and durability.
Results
The study revealed that the respondents were more satisfied with a seal-in liner with regards to fitting, sitting, and donning and doffing. Overall satisfaction increased with the use of a seal-in liner compared with the suction socket (P<.05). However, satisfaction with the prosthesis showed no significant differences in terms of walking (flat and uneven surfaces), appearance, and stair negotiation. Furthermore, problems experienced differed significantly between the 2 suspension systems (P<.05). Sweating, wounds, pain, irritation, pistoning, edema, smell, and sound were less problematic with the use of a seal-in liner, whereas durability was significantly better with the suction socket.
Conclusions
The results of the survey suggest that satisfaction and problems with prosthetic suspension in persons with transfemoral amputation can be improved with a seal-in liner compared with the suction socket, provided that the durability of the liner is enhanced.},

	Abstract = {Software maintenance may degrade the software quality. One of the primary ways to reduce undesired effects of maintenance is refactoring, which is a technique to improve software code quality without changing its observable behavior. To safely apply a refactoring, several issues must be considered: (i) identify the code parts that should be improved; (ii) determine the changes that must be applied to the code in order to improve its; (iii) evaluate the corrections impacts on code quality; and (iv) check that the observable behavior of the software will be preserved after applying the corrections. Given the amount of issues to consider, refactoring by hand has been assumed to be an expensive and error-prone task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an agent-based platform that enables to implement an agent able to autonomously deal with the above mentioned refactoring issues. To evaluate our approach, we performed an empirical study on code smells detection and correction, code quality improvement and preservation of the software observable behavior. To answer our research questions, we analyze 5 releases of Java open source projects, ranging from 166 to 711 classes.},

	Abstract = {With the emergence of tools to support visual mashup creation, tens of thousands of users have started to access, manipulate, and compose data from web sources. We have observed, however, that mashups created by these users tend to suffer from deficiencies that propagate as mashups are reused, which happens frequently. To address these deficiencies, we would like to bring some of the benefits of software engineering techniques to the end users creating these programs. In this work, we focus on identifying code smells indicative of the deficiencies we observed in web mashups programmed in the popular Yahoo! Pipes environment. Through an empirical study, we explore the impact of those smells on the preferences of 61 users, and observe that a significant majority of users prefer mashups without smells. We then introduce refactorings targeting those smells. These refactorings reduce the complexity of the mashup programs, increase their abstraction, update broken data sources and dated components, and standardize their structures to fit the community development patterns. Our assessment of a sample of over 8,000 mashups shows that smells are present in 81 percent of them and that the proposed refactorings can reduce the number of smelly mashups to 16 percent, illustrating the potential of refactoring to support the thousands of end-users programming mashups. Further, we explore how the smells and refactorings can apply to other end-user programming domains to show the generalizability of our approach.},

	Abstract = {Several studies are focused on the study of code smells and many detection techniques have been proposed. In this scenario, the use of rules involving software-metrics has been widely used in refactoring tools as a mechanism to detect code smells automatically. However, actual approaches present two unsatisfactory aspects: they present a low agreement in its results and, they do not consider the developers' feedback. In this way, these approaches detect smells that are not relevant to the developers. In order to solve the above mentioned unsatisfactory aspects in the state-of the-art of code smells detection, we propose the Smell Platform able to recognize code smells more relevant to developers by using its feedback. In this paper we present how such platform is able to detect four well known code smells. Finally, we evaluate the Smell Platform comparing its results with traditional detection techniques.},

From 1999 to 2003, except the sustainability of city institution is declining, the sustainability of economy, society and environment all are being improved continuously. However, compared with other capital cities in China, there still remain some gaps in the sustainable urban development aspects. As far as the coordination of sustainable city development is concerned, it is a downward trend in next few years. The coordination between environment and institution is the worst, and it is also very disharmony between economy development and the environment development in Shijiazhuang},

@article{TRABANINO20041904,
	Abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in cell communication processes and with mediating such senses as vision, smell, taste, and pain. They constitute a prominent superfamily of drug targets, but an atomic-level structure is available for only one GPCR, bovine rhodopsin, making it difficult to use structure-based methods to design receptor-specific drugs. We have developed the MembStruk first principles computational method for predicting the three-dimensional structure of GPCRs. In this article we validate the MembStruk procedure by comparing its predictions with the high-resolution crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin. The crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin has the second extracellular (EC-II) loop closed over the transmembrane regions by making a disulfide linkage between Cys-110 and Cys-187, but we speculate that opening this loop may play a role in the activation process of the receptor through the cysteine linkage with helix 3. Consequently we predicted two structures for bovine rhodopsin from the primary sequence (with no input from the crystal structure)---one with the EC-II loop closed as in the crystal structure, and the other with the EC-II loop open. The MembStruk-predicted structure of bovine rhodopsin with the closed EC-II loop deviates from the crystal by 2.84{\AA} coordinate root mean-square (CRMS) in the transmembrane region main-chain atoms. The predicted three-dimensional structures for other GPCRs can be validated only by predicting binding sites and energies for various ligands. For such predictions we developed the HierDock first principles computational method. We validate HierDock by predicting the binding site of 11-cis-retinal in the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin. Scanning the whole protein without using any prior knowledge of the binding site, we find that the best scoring conformation in rhodopsin is 1.1{\AA} CRMS from the crystal structure for the ligand atoms. This predicted conformation has the carbonyl O only 2.82{\AA} from the N of Lys-296. Making this Schiff base bond and minimizing leads to a final conformation only 0.62{\AA} CRMS from the crystal structure. We also used HierDock to predict the binding site of 11-cis-retinal in the MembStruk-predicted structure of bovine rhodopsin (closed loop). Scanning the whole protein structure leads to a structure in which the carbonyl O is only 2.85{\AA} from the N of Lys-296. Making this Schiff base bond and minimizing leads to a final conformation only 2.92{\AA} CRMS from the crystal structure. The good agreement of the ab initio-predicted protein structures and ligand binding site with experiment validates the use of the MembStruk and HierDock first principles' methods. Since these methods are generic and applicable to any GPCR, they should be useful in predicting the structures of other GPCRs and the binding site of ligands to these proteins.},

Since the quality of the structure has major impact on the maintainability of a system, the structure has to be reconditioned from time to time. Even if recent advances in the fields of automated detection of bad smells and refactorings have made life easier for software engineers, this is still a very complex and resource consuming task.Search-based approaches have turned out to be helpful in aiding a software engineer to improve the subsystem structure of a software system. In this paper we show that such techniques are also applicable when reconditioning the class structure of a system. We describe a novel search-based approach that assists a software engineer who has to perform this task by suggesting a list of refactorings. Our approach uses an evolutionary algorithm and simulated refactorings that do not change the system's externally visible behavior. The approach is evaluated using the open-source case study JHotDraw.},

	Abstract = {This article presents an empirical and practice-based analysis of the question, why despite substantial investments, there are still major security weaknesses in today's information systems. Acknowledging that cyber security is not a purely technical discipline, the article takes a holistic approach and identifies four anti-patterns that are frequent in practice and detrimental to the goal of achieving strong cyber security. The first anti-pattern is that decisions about security are frequently based on intuition rather than data and rigor; this introduces cognitive biases and undermines decision quality. Second, many organizations fail to implement foundational security controls and consequently, are easy targets for opportunistic and novice attackers. Third, there is an overreliance on the relatively static threat knowledge in products such as virus scanners, while an inability to learn and adapt dynamically opens the door for advanced threats. Fourth, weaknesses in security governance create systemic control gaps and vulnerabilities. The article describes each anti-pattern and presents specific steps that organizations can take to overcome them.},

Gas chromatography--olfactometry (GC--O) and multidimensional gas chromatography--mass spectrometry (MDGC--MS) of the fraction which contained a significant amount of the target unknown compound revealed the cyclic 1,4-diketone, cis-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexanedione, which had a pungent odour, and was thus first identified in roasted coffee. Model experiments revealed that cis-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexanedione was formed via thermal degradation of sugars, especially monosaccharides, under alkaline conditions. Further, we demonstrated that 2-hydroxy-3-pentanone and 1-hydroxy-2-propanone, thermal degradation products of monosaccharides, were closely related to the formation of cis-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexanedione.},

In this paper, we use this electronic nose to classify the smell from 3 types of burning materials and then we apply the standard back propagation and recurrent back propagation neural networks to train and classify those burning smells. In the experiment, we test 3 kinds of joss stick, 2 brands of cigarette, and a mosquito coil. Moreover, we also measure the difference between concentration of smoke by varying the number of burning joss sticks. The results show that it is able to classify the smoke correctly. The idea of this research can be used for making a smart smoke detector in order to detect a harmful burning material before it is too late to stop the fire.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a discrete fruit fly optimization algorithm (DFOA) is proposed for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). Firstly, a two-part discrete array is presented to represent the solution. Secondly, the initialization based on K-means is proposed to take full use of the location information of the customers. The customers in each cluster are allocated to one vehicle. Meanwhile, the repair operation is designed for not taking the capacity constraint into account in the initialization. Due to the characteristics of the CVRP, it may be effective to exchange or reallocate the customers between the neighbor routes in the graph. Thus, the smell-based search and vision-based search with the specific problem feature are designed. Moreover, the elimination mechanism and the simulated annealing based search are used to balance the exploration and the exploitation capabilities. In addition, the effect of parameter setting is investigated by using the Taguchi method of design-of-experiment to obtain the suitable values. Finally, numerical tests with the benchmark instances are carried out, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Our understanding of how these technologies match the experiences with smell that people have or want to have is surprisingly limited. We therefore investigated the experience of smell and the emotions that accompany it. We collected stories from 439 participants who described personally memorable smell experiences in an online questionnaire. Based on the stories we developed 10 categories of smell experience. We explored the implications of the categories for smell-enhanced technology design by (a) probing participants to envision technologies that match their smell story and (b) having HCI researchers brainstorm technologies using the categories as design stimuli. We discuss how our findings can benefit research on personal memories, momentary and first time experiences, and wellbeing.},

	Abstract = {The senses we call upon when interacting with technology are very restricted. We mostly rely on vision and audition, increasingly harnessing touch, whilst taste and smell remain largely underexploited. In spite of our current knowledge about sensory systems and sensory devices, the biggest stumbling block for progress concerns the need for a deeper understanding of people's multisensory experiences in HCI. It is essential to determine what tactile, gustatory, and olfactory experiences we can design for, and how we can meaningfully stimulate such experiences when interacting with technology. Importantly, we need to determine the contribution of the different senses along with their interactions in order to design more effective and engaging digital multisensory experiences. Finally, it is vital to understand what the limitations are that come into play when users need to monitor more than one sense at a time. The aim of this workshop is to deepen and expand the discussion on touch, taste, and smell within the CHI community and promote the relevance of multisensory experience design and research in HCI.},

	Abstract = {Creating an accurate model of gas emissions is an important task in monitoring and surveillance applications. A promising solution for a range of real-world applications are gas-sensitive mobile robots with spectroscopy-based remote sensors that are used to create a tomographic reconstruction of the gas distribution. The quality of these reconstructions depends crucially on the chosen sensing geometry. In this paper we address the problem of sensor planning by investigating sensing geometries that minimize reconstruction errors, and then formulate an optimization algorithm that chooses sensing configurations accordingly. The algorithm decouples sensor planning for single high concentration regions (hotspots) and subsequently fuses the individual solutions to a global solution consisting of sensing poses and the shortest path between them. The proposed algorithm compares favorably to a template matching technique in a simple simulation and in a real-world experiment. In the latter, we also compare the proposed sensor planning strategy to the sensing strategy of a human expert and find indications that the quality of the reconstructed map is higher with the proposed algorithm.},

Since the beginning of the 1970's, the research of vision aids for the visually impaired people has been broadly extended. After introducing the traditional methods for guiding blind, two typical modes of mobility aid are presented in this paper. One called as ETA (short for electronic travel aids), bases on the other natural senses of the blind, such as hearing, touch, smell, feeling and etc, focusing on Meijer's voice system which is based on the blind's sensitive auditory senses and ENVS which is by means of haptic feedback. The other technique is artificial vision, using surgical methods of implanting visual prosthesis in the blind's healthy retina, cortex, or optic nerve. The prosthesis generates electrical impulse and evokes the perception of points of light in the patients' visual cortex. The first type is non-wounded for the blind while the second type is wounded for the blind. Besides these, comparisons between the above two techniques and the related researches have also been indicated in this paper},

The system consists of a gas sensor and an odor generator. The sensor measures the concentration variations of a gaseous chemical compound wafting in the air. The odor generator presents the user with an odor with amplified concentration variations. Thus, the user of the olfactory assist system can virtually have an enhanced sense of smell. The odor with four different intensities is generated by the current olfactory assist mask system. We first describe the experiments conducted to confirm that the subjects can surely discriminate the different intensities of the presented odor. The results of gas-plume tracking experiments show that the olfactory assist system can make tracking of an aerial odor plume much easier, because it allows the user to check the spatial concentration variations of a faint odor.},

These gases are hitherto detected on site survey by gas detection tube and spectrum sensor. However, there are some risks of investigator's health on the work of survey in these method. In this research, we suggested analysis of these gases by calculating the absorption of gases in infrared bands using satellite remote sensing with MODIS sensor and investigated detection state in applying actual cases. As a result, we confirmed generation of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide gases in several places such as hot springs, volcano and industrial waste illegal dumping site. These results suggest possibility of continuous observation of toxic gases by satellites and this may be useful tool on saving our safety.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we examine the possibility of improving the prediction performance of an olfactory biosensor through the use of temporal spiking data. We present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), in the form of an optimal hybrid Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) system for the classification of chemical odorants from olfactory receptor neuron spike responses of the Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly (DmOrs). The data used in this study contains the responses to 34 odorants from 6 individual DmOrs, of which we exploit the temporal spiking responses of a 500ms odorant stimulus window. We report, for the first time, the difference between the classification performance of the temporal spiking data to an equivalent spontaneous scalar dataset that we have reported previously. We demonstrate that a higher prediction (%) was obtained when using the temporal data, in which a greater number of validation odorants are identified to their correct chemical class. This work presents a novel technique to improve the classification performance of an olfactory biosensor, whilst maintaining a limited sensory array of 6 DmOr receptors.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents the application of differential electronic nose and support vector machine for recognition of the cigarette brands. Differential nose combines two identical gas sensor arrays mounted into two chambers. One array measures the gas of interest and the second the environmental air. Only differential signals of these two arrays are registered and subjected to further processing. Such organization of measurement eliminates the need for determination of the baseline value of resistance, since the differential signal is free of it. This system combined with support vector machine used as the classifier is well suited for very quick and on-line dynamic mode measurements. We have applied this system to the recognition of 11 cigarette brands on the basis of smell of their leaves. The performed experiments have proved that the developed e-nose based on the differential signals is capable to recognize the cigarette smells very quickly and with high accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Bounded model checking (BMC) has gained widespread industrial use due to its relative scalability. Its exhaustiveness over all valid input vectors allows it to expose arbitrarily complex design flaws. However, BMC is limited to analyzing only a specific time window, hence will only expose those flaws which manifest within that window and thus cannot readily prove correctness. The diameter of a design has thus become an important concept -- a bounded check of depth equal to the diameter constitutes a complete proof. While the diameter of a design may be exponential in the number of its state elements, in practice it often ranges from tens to a few hundred regardless of design size. Therefore, a powerful diameterover-approximation technique may enable automatic proofs that otherwise would be infeasible. Unfortunately, exact diameter calculation requires exponential resources, and over-approximation techniques may yield exponentially loose bounds. In this paper, we provide a general approach for enabling the use of structural transformations, such as redundancy removal, retiming, and target enlargement, to tighten the bounds obtained by arbitrary diameterapproximation techniques. Numerous experiments demonstrate that this approach may significantly increase the set of designs for which practically useful diameter bounds may be obtained.},

@article{CRASSO200911718,
	Abstract = {Designing a JEE (Java Enterprise Edition)-based enterprise application capable of achieving its performance objectives is rather hard. Predicting the performance of this type of systems at the design level is difficult and sometimes not viable, because this requires having precise knowledge of the expected load conditions and the underlying software infrastructure. Besides, the requirement for rapid time-to-market leads to postpone performance tuning until systems are developed, packaged and running. In this paper we present a novel approach for automatically detecting performance problems in JEE-based applications and, in turn, suggesting courses of actions to correct them. The idea is to allow developers to smoothly identify and eradicate performance anti-patterns by automatically analyzing execution traces. The approach has been implemented as a tool called JEETuningExpert, and validated using three well-known JEE reference applications. Specifically, we evaluated the effectiveness of JEETuningExpert for detecting performance problems, measured the overhead imposed by online monitoring each application and the improvements were achieved after following the suggested corrective actions. These results empirically showed that the refactored applications are 40.08%, 76.94% and 61.13% faster, on average.},

	Abstract = {In this retrospective we will review the paper "Java Quality Assurance by Detecting Code Smells" that was published ten years ago at WCRE. The work presents an approach for the automatic detection and visualization of code smells and discusses how this approach could be used in the design of a software inspection tool. The feasibility of the proposed approach was illustrated with the development of jCOSMO, a prototype code smell browser that detects and visualizes code smells in JAVA source code. It was the first tool to automatically detect code smells in source code, and we demonstrated the application of this tool in an industrial quality assessment case study. In addition to reviewing the WCRE 2002 work, we will discuss subsequent developments in this area by looking at a selection of papers that were published in its wake. In particular, we will have a look at recent related work in which we empirically investigated the relation between code smells and software maintainability in a longitudinal study where professional developers were observed while maintaining four different software systems that exhibited known code smells. We conclude with a discussion of the lessons learned and opportunities for further research.},

@inproceedings{7177672,
	Abstract = {One of the first biology lessons in grade school is of the five senses: sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. They are the (only) connection to the world and people around us. Of the five senses, touch is the one we take most for granted and least understand the devastating impact of its loss. The sense of touch comes from the skin, the largest sensory organ in the human body. For nearly 2 million people in the US and 185,000 more each year, the loss of sensation is one of the most significant effects of limb loss resulting from trauma or vascular disease. Body-powered prostheses are often preferred over more functional powered devices because the user can ``feel'' the pressure of a grip through a requisite body harness. Providing representative sensory information on the residual limb is unnatural and does not directly match the sensory locations expected by the user's visual experience of the prosthesis. We have addressed these challenges with permanently implanted, multi-contact nerve cuff electrodes on the residual ulnar, radial, and median nerves of subjects with limb loss. These electrodes directly and selectively activate the peripheral neural pathways, and hence all upstream pathways, normally responsible for sensation. Ninety percent of the channels produce physically unique locations of sensation, distributed around the hand and wrist. The quality of the sensation is controlled by using a patterned stimulation intensity. The pattern pulses are critical to the brain's interpretation of the sensation. Varying the pattern can produce multiple different sensations at a common location. The addition of sensation to the user during tasks improves fine motor control with standard myoelectric prostheses. The system has been implanted and stable for three years. The user reports feeling their hand - the missing hand - in touching and manipulating objects. Restoring feeling has allowed the individuals to, ``feel [my] hand for the first time since the accident,'' and ``feel [my] wife touch my hand.'' With more than five subject-years of experience, this work is leading the evolution of a new era in prostheses and haptic interfaces.},
