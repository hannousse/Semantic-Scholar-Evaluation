	Abstract = {Multimedia applications are often executed on standard personal computers. The absence of established standards has hindered the adoption of real-time scheduling solutions in this class of applications. Developers have adopted a wide range of heuristic approaches to achieve an acceptable timing behavior but the result is often unreliable. We propose a mechanism to extend the benefits of real-time scheduling to legacy applications based on the combination of two techniques: (1) a real-time monitor that observes and infers the activation period of the application, and (2) a feedback mechanism that adapts the scheduling parameters to improve its real-time performance.},

	Abstract = {We propose an adaptive scheduling technique to schedule highly dynamic multimedia tasks on a CPU. We use a combination of two techniques: the first one is a feedback mechanism to track the resource require- ments of the tasks based on ``local'' observations. The second one is a mechanism that operates with a ``global'' visibility, reclaiming unused bandwidth. The combination proves very effective: resource reclaim- ing increases the robustness of the feedback, while the identification of the correct bandwidth made by the feedback increases the effectiveness of the reclamation. We offer both theoretical results and an extensive experimental validation of the approach.},

	Abstract = {Increased chip temperature has been known to cause severe reliability problems and to signifi- cantly increase leakage power. The register file has been previously shown to exhibit the highest temperature compared to all other hardware components in a modern high-end embedded proces- sor, which makes it particularly susceptible to faults and elevated leakage power. We show that this is mostly due to the highly clustered register file accesses where a set of few registers phys- ically placed close to each other are accessed with very high frequency. We propose compile-time temperature-aware register reallocation methodologies for breaking such groups of registers and to uniformly distribute the accesses to the register file. This is achieved with no performance and no hardware overheads. We show that the underlying problem is NP-hard, and subsequently introduce and evaluate two efficient algorithmic heuristics. Our extensive experimental study demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed methodology.},

	Abstract = {Embedded systems generally interact in some way with the outside world. This may involve measuring sensors and controlling actuators, communicating with other systems, or interact- ing with users. These functions impose real-time constraints on system design. Verification of these specifications requires computing an upper bound on the worst-case execution time (WCET) of a hardware/software system. Furthermore, it is critical to derive a tight upper bound on WCET in order to make efficient use of system resources.
The problem of bounding WCET is particularly difficult on modern processors. These proces- sors use cache-based memory systems that vary memory access time based on the dynamic memory access pattern of the program. This must be accurately modeled in order to tightly bound WCET. Several analysis methods have been proposed to bound WCET on processors with instruction caches. Existing approaches either search all possible program paths, an intractable problem, or they use highly pessimistic assumptions to limit the search space. In this paper we present a more effective method for modeling instruction cache activity and computing a tight bound on WCET. The method uses an integer linear programming formulation and does not require explicit enumeration of program paths. The method is implemented in the program cinderella and we present some experimental results of this implementation.},

	Abstract = {System integration is the elephant in the china store of large-scale cyber-physical system (CPS) design. It would be hard to find any other technology that is more undervalued scientifically and at the same time has bigger impact on the presence and future of engineered systems. The unique challenges in CPS integration emerge from the heterogeneity of components and interactions. This heterogeneity drives the need for modeling and analyzing cross-domain interactions among physical and computational/networking domains and demands deep understanding of the effects of heterogeneous abstraction layers in the design flow. To address the challenges of CPS integration, significant progress needs to be made toward a new science and technology foundation that is model based, precise, and predictable. This paper presents a theory of composition for heterogeneous systems focusing on stability. Specifically, the paper presents a passivity-based design approach that decouples stability from timing uncertainties caused by networking and computation. In addition, the paper describes cross-domain abstractions that provide effective solution for model-based fully automated software synthesis and high-fidelity performance analysis. The design objectives demonstrated using the techniques presented in the paper are group coordination for networked unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and high-confidence embedded control software design for a quadrotor UAV. Open problems in the area are also discussed, including the extension of the theory of compositional design to guarantee properties beyond stability, such as safety and performance.},

	Abstract = {The emerging technologies such as the Internet-of-Things, sensors, communication networks, have been or will be introduced to conventional domotics to provide a wide variety of smart home services to facilitate the household appliances or home cares and improve the lifestyles of people. Currently, smart home system are integrated with different features from product line and equipped with various sensors and actuators to meet the requirements of house occupants by specifying their customised user policies. However, the introduction of features and policies may result in undesired behaviours, and this effect is known as feature interactions. In this study, the authors proposed a Semantic Web-based policy interaction detection method with rules to model smart home services and policies with the aids of ontological analysis in the smart home domain, so as to construct a semantic context for inferring the interaction of policies. The authors focus their work on user policies interaction, which are detected by using the Semantic Web rule language in semantic context. The approach is successfully applied to the smart home system and is able to detect 90 interactions among 32 user policies by automated reasoning with tools support as Prot{\'e}g{\'e} and Jess.},

	Abstract = {We propose the application of state-space techniques to develop a novel coupled cyber-physical system (CPS) model and use feedback control to dynamically adjust CPS resource use and performance. We investigate the use of a gain scheduled discrete linear quadratic regulator controller and a forward-propagation Riccati-based controller to handle the discrete-time-varying system. We demonstrate the value of our approach by conducting a disturbance-rejection case study for a small satellite (CubeSat) application in which resources required for attitude control are adjusted in real-time to maximize availability for other computational tasks. We evaluate CPS performance through a set of metrics quantifying physical system error and control effort as well as cyber resource utilization and compare these with traditional fixed-rate optimal control strategies. Results indicate that our proposed coupled CPS model and controller can provide physical system performance similar to fixed-rate optimal control strategies but with less control effort and much less computational utilization.},

	Abstract = {The smart home infrastructure features the automatic control of various household appliances in the advanced metering infrastructure, which enables the connection of individual smart home systems to a smart grid. In such an infrastructure, each smart meter receives electricity price from utilities and uses a smart controller to schedule the household appliances accordingly. This helps shift the heavy energy load from peak hours to nonpeak hours. Such an architecture significantly improves the reliability of the power grid through reducing the peak energy usage, while benefiting the customers through reducing electricity bills. This paper presents a tutorial on the development of the smart controller to schedule household appliances, which is also known as smart home scheduling. For each individual user, a dynamic programming-based algorithm that schedules household appliances with discrete power levels is introduced. Based on it, a game theoretic framework is designed for multi-user smart home scheduling to mitigate the accumulated energy usage during the peak hours. The simulation results demonstrate that it can reduce the electricity bill by 30.11% while still improving peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in the power grid. Furthermore, the deployment of smart home scheduling techniques in a big city is discussed. In such a context, the parallel computation is explored to tackle the large computational complexity, a machine assignment approximation algorithm is proposed to accelerate the smart home scheduling, and a new hieratical framework is proposed to reduce the communication overhead. The simulation results on large test cases demonstrate that the city level hierarchical smart home scheduling can achieve the bill reduction of 43.04% and the PAR reduction of 47.50% on average.},

	Abstract = {Digital control systems are traditionally designed independent of their implementation platform, assuming constant sensor sampling rates and processor response times. Applications are deployed to processors that are shared amongst control and noncontrol tasks, to maximize resource utilization. This potentially overlooks that computing mechanisms meant for improving average CPU usage, such as cache, interrupts, and task management through schedulers, contribute to nondeterministic interference between tasks. This response time jitter can result in reduced system stability, motivating further study by both the controls and computing communities to maximize CPU utilization, while maintaining physical system stability needs. In this letter, we describe an field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based embedded software platform coupled with a hardware plant emulator (as opposed to purely software-based simulations or hardware-in-the-loop setups) that forms a basis for safe and accurate analysis of cyber-physical systems. We model and analyze an inverted pendulum to demonstrate that our setup can provide a significantly more accurate representation of a real system.},

	Abstract = {Small intestine is the longest organ in the gastrointestinal tract where much of the digestion and the food absorption take place. Wireless video capsule endoscope (VCE) is the first device taking 2-D pictures from the lesions and the abnormalities in the entire length of the small intestine. Since precise localization and mapping inside the small intestine is a very challenging problem, we cannot measure the distance traveled by the VCE to associate lesions and abnormalities to locations inside the small intestine, and we cannot use the 2-D pictures to reconstruct the 3-D image of interior of the entire small intestine in vivo. This paper presents the architectural concept of a novel cyber physical system (CPS), which can utilize the 2-D pictures of the small intestine taken by the VCE to reconstruct the 3-D image of the small intestine in vivo. Hybrid localization and mapping techniques with millimetric accuracy for inside the small intestine is presented as an enabling technology to facilitate the reconstruction of 3-D images from the 2-D pictures. The proposed CPS architecture provides for large-scale virtual experimentations inside the human body without intruding the body with a sizable equipment using reasonable clinical experiments for validation. The 3-D imaging of the small intestine in vivo allows a lesion to be pinpointed for follow-up diagnosis and/or treatment and the abnormalities may be observed from different angles in 3-D images for more thorough examination.},

Our models are suitable for rapid system modeling and development; they can help the designers and the programmers develop new AmI applications more rapidly and conveniently. Using the simplified AmI physical structure model, the physical AmI supporting environment can be established easily and rapidly. Via the software architecture and data management model, AmI application systems achieve flexibility, service discovery, and interoperability, which are the most common technical limitations in other related systems. Furthermore, our models can also help the terminal users configure their own AmI system by themselves.

	Abstract = {In this paper, a machine learning (ML) approach is presented that exploits accelerometers data to deal with gesture recognition (GR) problems. The proposed methodology aims at providing high accuracy classification for home automation systems, which are generally user independent, device independent, and device orientation independent, an heterogeneous scenario that has not been fully investigated in previous GR literature. The approach illustrated in this paper is composed of three main steps: event identification; feature extraction; and ML-based classification. The elements of the novelty of the proposed approach are 1) a preprocessing phase based on principal component analysis to increase the performance in real-world scenario conditions and 2) the development of parsimonious novel classification techniques based on sparse Bayesian learning. This methodology is tested on two datasets of four gesture classes (horizontal, vertical, circles, and eight-shaped movements) and on a further dataset with eight classes. In order to authentically describe a real-world home automation environment, the gesture movements are collected from more than 30 people who freely perform any gesture. It results in a dictionary of 12 and 20 different movements, respectively, in the case of the four-class and the eight-class databases.},

	Abstract = {Home automation systems have emerged as one of the most attractive fields in engineering, thanks to the burgeoning demand from society for information systems. Today, the development of these systems is confined to the immediate context of the solution and is platform-dependent. This has intensified the need for suitable tools to tackle their development while enhancing quality and productivity. On one hand, domain specific languages allow the description of the system by means of graphic models easily and intuitively, using domain concepts. On the other hand, the model driven development approach stands out as a good option for solving the problems of the existing methods, as well as contributing tools that pioneer the development of domain specific languages. The present article proposes an alternative methodology and tools for the development of home automation applications following the model driven approach together with the use of a domain specific language.},

Although it is implemented by using a low-cost 8-bit microcontroller with only 8 Kbytes of ROM spaces, a time-sharing task scheduler and 10 PCIs are included in the firmware. Timer and counter control, logic functions, and temperature control are examples of PCIs. Thanks to the design of pseudo nodes, these PCIs can also be combined to implement more complex functions that home automation needs. These modules, up to 65536 theoretically, share the same IP address, and can be found over the network via different port numbers. No dedicated home server is necessary because the network communication (TCP/IP) is handled by the module. A remote control and monitoring software is also developed to let users control the home automation modules on the Internet. The programmable home automation module has a lower cost and better cost/performance ratio than current home automation modules},

	Abstract = {This letter presents a transducer network framework that supports the amalgamation of multiple transducers into single wireless nodes. This approach is aimed at decreasing energy consumption by reducing the number of wireless transceivers involved in such networks. To make wireless nodes easily reconfigurable, a plug and play mechanism is applied to enable the clustering of any number of transducers. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed to dynamically detect added and removed transducers from a node. Lastly, an XML based protocol is devised to allow nodes to communicate a description of their layout, measured data and control information. To verify the proposed framework, multiple reconfigurable wireless nodes are used to monitor the dynamic condition of a multiple rooms during a period of 24 hours in order to emulate a smart home scenario.},

	Abstract = {In recent, ZigBee is considered as a potential solution for a scalable and flexible home automation systems. However, several constraints of the ZigBee might create node failure or frequent link breakages and thus some nodes in the network might become orphans. This orphan problem of ZigBee might bring a big confusion to a home automation environment in which a number of consumer devices are interconnected in the multi-hop manner. Therefore, in this paper, an enhanced self-configuration (ESC) scheme is proposed, which can improve the robustness of the conventional ZigBee-based home automation systems by coping well with orphan propagation problem and dynamic error environments. Through experiments on real system implementation, it is demonstrated that the ESC is superior to the conventional ZigBee network in terms of delay and robustness.},

	Abstract = {Distributed and renewable-energy resources are likely to play an important role in the future energy landscape as consumers and enterprise energy users reduce their reliance on the main electricity grid as their source of electricity. Environmental or ambient sensing of parameters such as temperature and humidity, and amount of sunlight and wind, can be used to predict electricity demand from users and supply from renewable sources, respectively. In this paper, we describe a Smart Grid Cyber-Physical System (SG-CPS) comprising sensors that transmit real-time streams of sensed information to predictors of demand and supply of electricity and an optimization-based decision maker that uses these predictions together with real-time grid electricity prices and historical information to determine the quantity and timing of grid electricity purchases throughout the day and night. We investigate two forms of the optimization-based decision maker, one that uses linear programming and another that uses multi-stage stochastic programming. Our results show that sensing-driven predictions combined with the optimization-based purchasing decision maker hosted on the SG-CPS platform can cope well with uncertainties in demand, supply, and electricity prices and make grid electricity purchasing decisions that successfully keep both the occurrence of electricity shortfalls and the cost of grid electricity purchases low. We then examine the computational and memory requirements of the aforementioned prediction and optimization algorithms and find that they are within the capabilities of modern embedded system microprocessors and, hence, are amenable for deployment in typical households and communities.},

In this paper, a multiobjective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed for optimal energy use in a smart home, considering a meaningful balance between energy saving and a comfortable lifestyle. Thorough incorporation of a mixed objective function under different system constraints and user preferences, the proposed algorithm could not only reduce the domestic energy usage and utility bills, but also ensure an optimal task scheduling and a thermal comfort zone for the inhabitants. To verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, a number of simulations were performed under different scenarios using real data, and the obtained results were compared in terms of total energy consumption cost, users' convenience rates, and thermal comfort level.},

	Abstract = {Smart building systems can provide flexible and configurational sensing and controlling operations according to users' requirements. As the number and the complexity of service rules customized by users have significantly increased, there is an increasing danger of conflict during the interaction process between users and the system. To address this issue, we propose a new rule conflict detection scheme tailored for the smart building system. First, we present a formal rule model UTEA based on User, Triggers, Environment entities, and Actuators. This model can handle not only controlled devices with discrete status but also real-valued environmental data such as temperature and humidity. In addition, this model takes multiple users with different authorities into account. Second, we define 11 rule relations and further classify conflicts into five categories. Third, we implement a rule storage system for detecting conflicts and design a conflict detection algorithm, which can detect the conflict between two rules as well as cycle conflict/multicross contradiction among multiple rules. We evaluated our scheme in a real smart building system with more than 30 000 service rules. The experiment results show that our scheme improves the performance in terms of error/missed-detection rates and running time.},

In addition to power-consuming appliances, we adopt a photovoltaic (PV) panel as a power-producing appliance that acts as a micro-grid. An appliance operation is modeled in terms of uninterruptible sequence phases, given in a load demand profile with a goal of minimizing electricity cost fulfilling duration, energy requirement, and user preference constraints. An optimization algorithm, which can provide a schedule for smart home appliance usage, is proposed based on the mixed-integer programming technique. Simulation results demonstrate the utility of our proposed solution for appliance scheduling. We further show that adding a PV system in the home results in the reduction of electricity bills and the export of energy to the national grid in times when solar energy production is more than the demand of the home.},

The introduced approach balances the management of the complexity related to the enactment of an ambient intelligence scenario between the agents and the structured environment they populate. The dynamics of local actions and interactions of agents situated in this environment originates the overall organized system behaviour. The environment is shaped according to the notion of active coordination artifact, whose seminal definition was given in Computer Supported Cooperative Work literature by Schmidt and Simone and then evolved in other research contexts. A technique to configure and interact with such environments, i.e. the composition of device functionalities according to their high-level features, and services provided, is presented.

An unsupervised, data-driven, fuzzy technique is proposed for extracting fuzzy membership functions and rules that represent the user's particularized behaviors in the environment. The user's learned behaviors can then be adapted online in a life-long mode to satisfy the different user and system objectives. We have performed unique experiments in which the intelligent agent has learned and adapted to the user's behavior, during a stay of five consecutive days in the intelligent dormitory (iDorm), which is a real ubiquitous computing environment test bed. Both offline and online experimental results are presented comparing the performance of our technique with other approaches.

The problem of user localization is considered with great care to minimize the invasiveness of the monitoring system.

	Abstract = {Home automation refers to a system that is used to control devices around the home. These devices can include doors, lights, surveillance systems, and consumer electronics. A user can control a variety of home devices with the help of a home automation system. To provide mobility, a mobile phone-based home automation has been developed. As another approach toward home automation, an Internet-based home automation system has been proposed, providing a graphic user interface. However, these systems lack userfriendliness and are neither intuitive nor realistic. To improve the user-friendliness of the interface, a 3D view interface was designed. However, its level of realism was low. In this study, to provide a more realistic interface, a 3D virtual world is adopted as the user interface for a home automation system. Additionally, a home server is used as a controller for home devices. As an information exchange format between the virtual and the real world, a control protocol that works under a standardization process is introduced. With the help of a 3D virtual world, a user can control and monitor home devices via a user-friendly interface that works both intuitively and realistically anywhere and anytime through the Internet.},

	Abstract = {The problem of emergence of fatal bugs in the software that drives microprocessors embedded in digital home appliances necessitates a rescrutiny of strategies that are used to revamp software functionalities of such systems. Existing strategies to remedy such problems involve disintegrating the entire system in order to replace the execution of a defective program of the ROM that stores the software. This paper proposes an efficient and a facile technique that corrects the functions of the ROM using a remote controller based on wireless message transmission and reception. The main advantage of this technique is that unlike existing techniques it does not need entire system disintegration to fix the ROM running the software program. In addition, we extend the proposed technique to be applied for a digital convergence appliance embedding two microprocessors by means of a CD-R instead of the remote controller.},

	Abstract = {There is a worldwide trend to modernize old power grid infrastructures to form future smart grids, which will achieve efficient, flexible energy consumption by using the latest technologies in communication, computing, and control. Smart grid initiatives are moving power systems curricula toward smart grids. Although the components of smart grids fall within the broader discipline of electrical and computer engineering, undergraduate students are rarely assigned single design projects that require classic power systems knowledge combined with communication, computing, and control. Therefore, as a significant step toward potential curriculum changes, this paper presents such a project, a smart home test bed based on the pedagogical model of project-based learning (PBL) for undergraduate education. The proposed test bed allows undergraduates to gain key knowledge in smart grid topics, such as flattening demand peaks, real-time price response, wireless sensor networks, machine learning, pattern recognition, embedded system programming, user interface design, circuit design, and databases. This is well aligned with smart grid initiatives and provides a platform for students to develop their creativity in engineering design. It also offers real-life examples to be used for raising general public awareness of energy conservation.},

This paper proposes a new infrastructure that allows the exchange of data from the iDTV to home automation devices, such as sensors, mobile devices, and so on. The integration process among the involved technologies as well as each element in the proposed infrastructure is described in details. This model is supported by open services gateway initiative (OSGi), as a framework for networked devices, and the Brazilian reference middleware, Ginga. Thus it is possible to use devices services in OSGi-based home networks, through the digital TV.

Recently, the scope of WSN technologies has been expanded to places such as the home, in order to provide the residents with various intelligent services, such as home automation services or home energy management services. However, due to their architectural constraints, such as the trade-off between the performance and cost, WSNs are not effectively implemented in home environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a ZigBee-based intelligent self-adjusting sensor (ZiSAS) in order to address these concerns. This paper presents a situation-based selfadjusting scheme, an event-based self-adjusting sensor network, and hardware and middleware implementation. We also introduce some smart home services using the proposed system. We implemented our system in real test bed and conducted an experiment.

This interaction is required to enhance communication about objects and places to improve travel decisions. Our intelligent system is a human-in-the-loop cyber-physical system that interprets ubiquitous semantic entities by interacting with the physical world and the cyber domain, viz., 1) visual cues and distance sensing of material objects as line-of-sight interaction to interpret location-context information, and 2) data (tweets) from social media as event-based interaction to interpret situational vibes. The case study elaborates our proposed localization methods (viz., topological, landmark, metric, crowdsourced, and sound localization) for applications in way finding, way confirmation, user tracking, socialization, and situation alerts.

For each audio frame, important atoms from the Gabor dictionary are selected by using the Matching Pursuit algorithm. After the system disregards phase and position information, the scale and frequency of the atoms are extracted to construct a scale-frequency map. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) are then applied to the scale-frequency map, subsequently generating the proposed feature. During the classification phase, a segment-level multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) is operated. Experiments on a 17-class sound database indicate that the proposed approach can achieve an accuracy rate of 86.21%. Furthermore, a comparison reveals that the proposed approach is superior to the other time-frequency methods.},

	Abstract = {With the fast development of wireless communications, ZigBee and semiconductor devices, home automation networks have recently become very popular. Since typical consumer products deployed in home automation networks are often powered by tiny and limited batteries, one of the most challenging research issues is concerning energy reduction and the balancing of energy consumption across the network in order to prolong the home network lifetime for consumer devices. The introduction of clustering and sink mobility techniques into home automation networks have been shown to be an efficient way to improve the network performance and have received significant research attention. Taking inspiration from nature, this paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based clustering algorithm specifically with mobile sink support for home automation networks. In this work, the network is divided into several clusters and cluster heads are selected within each cluster. Then, a mobile sink communicates with each cluster head to collect data directly through short range communications. The ACO algorithm has been utilized in this work in order to find the optimal mobility trajectory for the mobile sink. Extensive simulation results from this research show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves home network performance when using mobile sinks in terms of energy consumption and network lifetime as compared to other routing algorithms currently deployed for home automation networks.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate data fusion mechanism through temporal and spatial correlations for Home Automation Networks. Data fusion is a process to decrease the transmission number of similar sensory values, thus its importance is in the spotlight because energy efficiency is a main issue on the networks. In order to reduce the transmission amount of data, each device decides whether to send new sensing data or not after comparing it with previous sensing values(temporal correlation) and the last transmitted value of the neighbor device(spatial correlation) which is a one-hop range via a predetermined user threshold. Our mechanism includes a commit and assurance process for security enhancement. For the performance evaluation of our mechanism, we use the temperature data measured on real networks and extend them using Gaussian distribution in order to obtain the more test data sets. The simulation results show that using both types of correlations is more efficient than just using one type for data fusion in terms of the data transmission amount and accuracy. Moreover, our simulation for the commit and assurance process demonstrates only slightly more energy.},

	Abstract = {In the modern smart home and community, smart meters have been massively deployed for the replacement of traditional analog meters. Although it significantly reduces the cost of data collection as the meter readings are wireless transmitted, a smart meter is not tamper-resistant. As a consequence, the smart grid infrastructure is under threat of energy theft, by means of attacking a smart meter so that it undercounts the electricity usage. Deployment of feeder remote terminal unit (FRTU) helps narrow the search zone of energy theft in smart home and community. However, due to budgetary limit, utility companies can only afford to insert the minimum number of FRTUs. This imposes a signifcant challenge to deploy the minimum number of FRTUs while each smart meter is still effectively monitored. To the best of our knowledge, the only work addressing this problem is [1], which uses stochastic optimization methods. Their algorithm is not very practical as it cannot handle large distribution networks because of the scalability issue. Due to the inherent heuristic and non-deterministic nature, there is no guarantee on the solution quality as well. Thus, the high performance energy theft detection is still needed for this energy theft problem. In order to resolve this challenge, we propose a new dynamic programming algorithm that inserts the minimum number of FRTUs satisfying the detection rate constraint. It evaluates every candidate solution in a bottom-up fashion using an innovative pruning technique. As a deterministic polynomial time algorithm, it is able to handle large distribution networks. In contrast to [1] which can only handle small system, our technique can perform FRTU insertion for a large scale power system. Our experimental results demonstrate that the average number of FRTUs required is only 26% of the number of smart meters in the community. Compared with the previous work, the number of FRTUs is reduced by 18.8% while the solution quality in terms of anomaly coverage index metric is still improved.},

	Abstract = {Elderly in-home assistance (EHA) has traditionally been tackled by human caregivers to equip the elderly with homecare assistance in their daily living. The emerging ambience intelligence (AmI) technology suggests itself to be of great potential for EHA applications, owing to its effectiveness in building a context-aware environment that is sensitive and responsive to the presence of humans. This paper presents a case-driven AmI (C-AmI) system, aiming to sense, predict, reason, and act in response to the elderly activities of daily living (ADLs) at home. The C-AmI system architecture is developed by synthesizing various sensors, activity recognition, case-based reasoning, along with EHA-customized knowledge, within a coherent framework. An EHA information model is formulated through the activity recognition, case comprehension, and assistive action layers. The rough set theory is applied to model ADLs based on the sensor platform embedded in a smart home. Assistive actions are fulfilled with reference to a priori case solutions and implemented within the AmI system through human-object-environment interactions. Initial findings indicate the potential of C-AmI for enhancing context awareness of EHA applications.},

	Abstract = {In the smart grid, a neighborhood area network (NAN) is a part of the cyber-physical system that achieves two-way communications between smart meters and meter data management system (MDMS). In this paper, we study the energy efficiency issue for uplink transmissions from NAN gateways to the concentrator connecting the MDMS. Classical power control schemes targeting pure bits/joule energy efficiency for multiaccess wireless networks do not fit in well due to the stringent data rate reliability requirement caused by the massive amount of smart meter data. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical uplink transmission power control scheme for a NAN using a two-level Stackelberg game approach. Focusing on linear receivers, the Stackelberg equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves both data rate reliability and energy efficiency.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present the problem of mixed sound event verification in a wireless sensor network for home automation systems. In home automation systems, the sound recognized by the system becomes the basis for performing certain tasks. However, if a target source is mixed with another sound due to simultaneous occurrence, the system would generate poor recognition results, subsequently leading to inappropriate responses. To handle such problems, this study proposes a framework, which consists of sound separation and sound verification techniques based on a wireless sensor network (WSN), to realize sound-triggered automation. In the sound separation phase, we present a convolutive blind source separation system with source number estimation using time-frequency clustering. An accurate mixing matrix can be estimated by the proposed phase compensation technique and used for reconstructing the separated sound sources. In the verification phase, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and Fisher scores that are derived from the wavelet packet decomposition of signals are used as features for support vector machines. Finally, a sound of interest can be selected for triggering automated services according to the verification result. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of the proposed system for mixed sound verification in WSN-based home environments.},

	Abstract = {The development of a trustworthy smart grid requires a deeper understanding of potential impacts resulting from successful cyber attacks. Estimating feasible attack impact requires an evaluation of the grid's dependency on its cyber infrastructure and its ability to tolerate potential failures. A further exploration of the cyber-physical relationships within the smart grid and a specific review of possible attack vectors is necessary to determine the adequacy of cybersecurity efforts. This paper highlights the significance of cyber infrastructure security in conjunction with power application security to prevent, mitigate, and tolerate cyber attacks. A layered approach is introduced to evaluating risk based on the security of both the physical power applications and the supporting cyber infrastructure. A classification is presented to highlight dependencies between the cyber-physical controls required to support the smart grid and the communication and computations that must be protected from cyber attack. The paper then presents current research efforts aimed at enhancing the smart grid's application and infrastructure security. Finally, current challenges are identified to facilitate future research efforts.},

Since the sensor nodes are equipped with small, often irreplaceable, batteries with limited power capacity, it is essential that the network be energy-efficient in order to maximize its lifetime. Our study, described in this paper, was divided into two classes: the primary class was to set a gateway-selection level and the secondary class was to propose an offer of a home automation using a routing technique centered on a sensor network to set a flooding level. The proposed scheme is to increase the life time of the sensor network with the integrated gateway node. The IGN increases the life time of the network to integrate the multiple gateway nodes.},

	Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate the computation with physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. CPS was identified as one of the eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques. Finally, some significant research problems are identified for enlightening the subsequent studies.},

	Abstract = {The imperfect nature of context in Ambient Intelligence environments and the special characteristics of the entities that possess and share the available context information render contextual reasoning a very challenging task. The accomplishment of this task requires formal models that handle the involved entities as autonomous logic-based agents and provide methods for handling the imperfect and distributed nature of context. This paper proposes a solution based on the Multi-Context Systems paradigm in which local context knowledge of ambient agents is encoded in rule theories (contexts), and information flow between agents is achieved through mapping rules that associate concepts used by different contexts. To handle imperfect context, we extend Multi-Context Systems with nonmonotonic features: local defeasible theories, defeasible mapping rules, and a preference ordering on the system contexts. On top of this model, we have developed an argumentation framework that exploits context and preference information to resolve potential conflicts caused by the interaction of ambient agents through the mappings, and a distributed algorithm for query evaluation.},

	Abstract = {In this letter, we detail a modular approach for measuring the secondary physical and emotional effects of ambient intelligence (AmI) technology in traffic. Using the case of merges on to a highway, we assess the results of a system that advises the driver to change early to a lane on the left to create space for merging cars downstream (tested using a cellular automata simulation). The indirect impact of the system downstream, namely how the remaining lane changes from the merge lane to the innermost lane proceed, is then evaluated using a time-discrete, space-continuous microscopic traffic simulation tool. This yields detailed results concerning driver interactions that can also be used to derive an estimate of driver anger in the situation. We have used real geographic, traffic and psychological data to test the system, and different models are used to accomplish various tasks. The approach yields (surprisingly) negative results concerning the indirect emotional impact of this AmI intervention which may be due to the nature of the lane changing model used and the chosen parameters. We argue that such an approach is also applicable to similar types of systems, where different data and model types are suited to different scenario elements.},

High penetration of such devices creates new dynamics for which the current power distribution systems are inadequate.

A goal-based holonic multiagent system (HMAS) is presented in this paper to achieve this objective. This paper provides details on design of the HMAS for operation of power distribution systems. Various operating modes and associated goals are discussed. Finally, the role of HMAS is demonstrated for two applications in distribution systems. The first one is associated with control of reactive power at solar photovoltaic installations at individual homes for optimal operation of the system. The second deals with the state estimation of the system leveraging different measurements available from smart meters at homes.},

With observations from a variety of multimodal and unobtrusive wireless sensors seamlessly integrated into ambient-intelligence compliant objects (AICOs), the approach infers a single resident's interleaved activities by utilizing a generalized and enhanced Bayesian Network fusion engine with inputs from a set of the most informative features. These features are collected by ranking their usefulness in estimating activities of interest. Additionally, each feature reckons its corresponding reliability to control its contribution in cases of possible device failure, therefore making the system more tolerant to inevitable device failure or interference commonly encountered in a wireless sensor network, and thus improving overall robustness. This work is part of an interdisciplinary Attentive Home pilot project with the goal of fulfilling real human needs by utilizing context-aware attentive services. We have also created a novel application called ldquoActivity Maprdquo to graphically display ambient-intelligence-related contextual information gathered from both humans and the environment in a more convenient and user-accessible way.

	Abstract = {The healthcare system is in crisis due to challenges including escalating costs, the inconsistent provision of care, an aging population, and high burden of chronic disease related to health behaviors. Mitigating this crisis will require a major transformation of healthcare to be proactive, preventive, patient-centered, and evidence-based with a focus on improving quality-of-life. Information technology, networking, and biomedical engineering are likely to be essential in making this transformation possible with the help of advances, such as sensor technology, mobile computing, machine learning, etc. This paper has three themes: 1) motivation for a transformation of healthcare; 2) description of how information technology and engineering can support this transformation with the help of computational models; and 3) a technical overview of several research areas that illustrate the need for mathematical modeling approaches, ranging from sparse sampling to behavioral phenotyping and early detection. A key tenet of this paper concerns complementing prior work on patient-specific modeling and simulation by modeling neuropsychological, behavioral, and social phenomena. The resulting models, in combination with frequent or continuous measurements, are likely to be key components of health interventions to enhance health and wellbeing and the provision of healthcare.},

	Abstract = {A cyber-physical system (CPS) consists of a group of interlinked networked objects. CPSs are characteristically different from the traditional internetworked systems (e.g., Internet) due to the operating environment and their applications, which impose high reliability constraints on them. One of the fundamental considerations for enabling this technology is the medium access control (MAC). The traditional IEEE 802.11-based MAC layer solutions need to be revamped. In order to increase the efficiency of data transmission, we introduce a new approach, which argues the replacement of the traditional backoff algorithm of 802.11. The proposed approach attempts to address some of the obligations posed by CPS networks. At the core of the proposed solution is the introduction of the adaptability factor to the traditional backoff procedure, which can help CPS networks operate under diverse environmental conditions. In order to survive the high degrees of dynamism of these networks, each of the nodes is equipped with a learning automaton, which adapts to the changing environment and provides the node with the most optimized value. The consistent outperformance of the proposed approach when compared with similar existing approaches under different simulation scenarios exhibits its efficacy. The critical parameters, such as packet delivery ratio and delay, are improved by up to 40% and 27%, respectively, over the traditional protocols.},

	Abstract = {In smart building systems, the automatic control of devices relies on matching the sensed environment information to customized rules. With the development of wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs), low-cost and self-organized wireless sensors and actuators can enhance smart building systems, but produce abundant sensing data. Therefore, a rule engine with ability of efficient rule matching is the foundation of WSANs based smart building systems. However, traditional rule engines mainly focus on the complex processing mechanism and omit the amount of sensing data, which are not suitable for large scale WSANs based smart building systems. To address these issues, we build an efficient rule engine. Specifically, we design an atomic event extraction module for extracting atomic event from data messages, and then build a β-network to acquire the atomic conditions for parsing the atomic trigger events. Taking the atomic trigger events as the key set of MPHF, we construct the minimal perfect hash table which can filter the majority of the unused atomic event with O(1) time overhead. Moreover, a rule engine adaption scheme is proposed to minimize the rule matching overhead. We implement the proposed rule engine in a practical smart building system. The experimental results show that the rule engine can perform efficiently and flexibly with high data throughput and large rule set.},

	Abstract = {In recent times, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become the backbone of many systems. Smart homes based on WSN protocols are used to provide an assisted living environment to humans. The currently reported smart home systems based on generalized WSN protocols suffer from complexity, large data handling, and data transmission delay. This paper has reported a new protocol especially developed to address smart homes for assisted living. The whole purpose of a smart home is to provide a safe environment for the well-being of its inhabitants. Ergo, the protocol is named as wellness sensor networks. The developed protocol has been used in an old home built in 1938, which was converted into a smart home with the use of sensing technologies.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a robust environmental sound recognition system using a fast noise suppression approach for home automation applications. The system comprises a fast subspace-based noise suppression module and a sound classification module. For the noise suppression module, we propose a noise suppression method that applies fast subspace approximations in the wavelet domain. We show that this method offers a lower computational cost than conventional methods. In the sound classification module, we use a feature extraction method that is also based on the wavelet subspace, derived from seventeen critical bands in a signal's wavelet packet transform. Furthermore, we create a multiclass support vector machine by employing probability product kernels. The experimental results for ten classes of various environmental sounds show that the proposed system offers robust performance in environmental sound recognition tasks.},

This paper proposes a smart HEMS architecture that considers both energy consumption and generation simultaneously. ZigBee-based energy measurement modules are used to monitor the energy consumption of home appliances and lights. A PLC-based renewable energy gateway is used to monitor the energy generation of renewable energies. The home server gathers the energy consumption and generation data, analyzes them for energy estimation, and controls the home energy use schedule to minimize the energy cost. The remote energy management server aggregates the energy data from numerous home servers, compares them, and creates useful statistical analysis information. By considering both energy consumption and generation, the proposed HEMS architecture is expected to optimize home energy use and result in home energy cost saving.},

	Abstract = {Every home has its own unique considerations for location-aware applications. This makes a flexible architecture very crucial for efficiently integrating various tracking devices/models for adapting to real human needs. Here, we propose a reciprocal and extensible architecture to flexibly add/remove tracking sensors/models for tracking multiple targets in a smart home. Regarding tracking devices, we employ sensors from two different categories, those with seamless sensors and those with seamful ones. This allows us to take human-centric needs into consideration and to facilitate reciprocal and cooperative interaction among sensors from the two categories. Such reciprocal cooperation aims to increase the accuracy of location estimates and to compensate for the limitations of each sensor or a tracking algorithm, which allows us to track multiple targets simultaneously in a more reliable way. Moreover, the approach demonstrated in this paper can serve as a guideline to help users customize sensor arrangements to fulfill their requirements. Our experimental results, which comprise three tracking scenarios using a load sensory floor as the seamless sensor and RF identifications (RFIDs) as seamful sensors, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.},

Backward-compatible enhancements to EIB/KNX domotic standard allow to support the semantic characterization of user profiles and device functionalities, thus enabling: 1) negotiation of the most suitable home services/functionalities according to implicit and explicit user needs and 2) device-driven interaction for adapting the environment to context evolution.

In this paper, we propose ADCC(Adaptive Duty-cycle Based Congestion Control), a lightweight congestion control scheme using duty-cycle adjustment for wireless sensor networks. This scheme uses both the resource control and traffic control approaches according to the amount of network traffic for the congestion avoidance.

	Abstract = {Companies producing consumer products have begun working on ways to control their products over the IP (internet protocol). Multinational electronics firms are marking a fair share of their lines using technologies like the RF ID, a front end to the IP networks. The main feature that is achieved by the already-existing home automation systems is that, every piece of equipment integrated is to be controlled by a central unit. The proposed solutions based on this idea are relatively expensive and difficult to configure per each system environment. IP based systems are supposed to be simpler to be accessed and easier to manipulate, with the only necessity being, close proximity to a direct internet connection. With this in mind, we designed a low cost hardware/software framework based on a unit what we call the IPAcBox which allows home/industrial automation systems to be accessed and controlled through a direct internet connection right out of the box even in dynamic IP configurations. We have developed the software and hardware infrastructure necessary for this system. This research consists of designing the server and the client side software, the communication protocols and addressing some hardware issues, along with a proposal to further our studies.},

	Abstract = {A challenge facing industrial control network administrators is protecting the typically large number of connected assets for which they are responsible. These cyber devices may be tightly coupled with the physical processes they control and human induced failures risk dire real-world consequences. Dynamic virtual honeypots are effective tools for observing and attracting network intruder activity. This paper presents a design and implementation for self-configuring honeypots that passively examine control system network traffic and actively adapt to the observed environment. In contrast to prior work in the field, six tools were analyzed for suitability of network entity information gathering. Ettercap, an established network security tool not commonly used in this capacity, outperformed the other tools and was chosen for implementation. Utilizing Ettercap XML output, a novel four-step algorithm was developed for autonomous creation and update of a Honeyd configuration. This algorithm was tested on an existing small campus grid and sensor network by execution of a collaborative usage scenario. Automatically created virtual hosts were deployed in concert with an anomaly behavior (AB) system in an attack scenario. Virtual hosts were automatically configured with unique emulated network stack behaviors for 92% of the targeted devices. The AB system alerted on 100% of the monitored emulated devices.},

	Abstract = {We describe algorithmic enhancements to a decision-support tool that residential consumers can utilize to optimize their acquisition of electrical energy services. The decision-support tool optimizes energy services provision by enabling end users to first assign values to desired energy services, and then scheduling their available distributed energy resources (DER) to maximize net benefits. We chose particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the corresponding optimization problem because of its straightforward implementation and demonstrated ability to generate near-optimal schedules within manageable computation times. We improve the basic formulation of cooperative PSO by introducing stochastic repulsion among the particles. The improved DER schedules are then used to investigate the potential consumer value added by coordinated DER scheduling. This is computed by comparing the end-user costs obtained with the enhanced algorithm simultaneously scheduling all DER, against the costs when each DER schedule is solved separately. This comparison enables the end users to determine whether their mix of energy service needs, available DER and electricity tariff arrangements might warrant solving the more complex coordinated scheduling problem, or instead, decomposing the problem into multiple simpler optimizations.},

	Abstract = {The study of today's cyber-physical system (CPS) has been an important research area. Internet data centers (IDCs) are energy consuming CPSs that support the reliable operations of many important online services. Along with the increasing Internet services and cloud computing in recent years, the power usage associated with IDC operations had been surging significantly. Such mass power consumption has brought extremely heavy burden on IDC operators. While most previous work only consider about dynamical optimization of IDC under electricity markets, the reaction of IDC toward electricity market has been overlooked. Due to the fact that IDCs are usually large-volume users in the electricity market, they might have market power to affect the electricity price. In this paper, we study how to address the challenge of interactions between IDC operation and electricity market price. To this end, we propose a supply function to model the market power of IDC and formulate a total electricity cost minimization problem as a non-linear programming. Then we present CMC algorithm inspired by the economics concept. CMC algorithm not only solves the optimization problem efficiently, but also uncovers the impetus of the work load distribution. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively minimize the total electricity cost of IDCs by adaptively handling the interaction between IDCs and smart grid.},

	Abstract = {A century of revolutionary growth in aviation has made global travel a reality of daily life. Aircraft and air transport overcame a number of formidable challenges and hostilities in the physical world. Success in this arduous pursuit was not without leveraging advances of the ``cyber'' layer, i.e., digital computing, data storage and networking, and software, in hardware, infrastructures, humans, and processes, within the airframe, in space, and on the ground. The physical world, however, is evolving continuously in the 21st century, contributing traffic growth and diversity, fossil fuel and ozone layer depletion, demographics and economy dynamics, as some major factors in aviation performance equations. In the next 100 years, apart from breakthrough physical advances, such as aircraft structural and electrical designs, we envision aviation's progress will depend on conquering cyberspace challenges and adversities, while safely and securely transitioning cyber benefits to the physical world. A tight integration of cyberspace with the physical world streamlines this vision. This paper proposes a novel cyber-physical system (CPS) framework to understand the cyber layer and cyber-physical interactions in aviation, study their impacts, and identify valuable research directions. This paper presents CPS challenges and solutions for aircraft, aviation users, airports, and air traffic management.},

Development of an effective negotiation model for facilitating the bi-directional energy trading between the utility grid and the building is important for enhancing the building intelligence. In this paper, a negotiation agent based on adaptive attitude bidding strategy (AABS) is proposed. A comprehensive set of factors for the integrated smart building and utility grid system is taken into account in developing the negotiation model. The AABS based negotiation agent turns out to be able to dynamically adjust its behavior in response to varying attitudes in the negotiation process. In addition, an improved particle swarm optimization-adaptive attitude bidding strategy (PSO-AABS) based negotiation agent is developed for adaptively adjusting the trader's decisions according to the opponent's behaviors. It turns out to be capable of making rational deals in bi-directional energy trading by maximizing the trader's payoffs with reduced negotiation time. The feasibility of the proposed negotiation agents is evaluated by the simulation results.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, ZigBee has been proven to be an excellent solution to create scalable and flexible home automation networks. In a home automation network, consumer devices typically collect data from a home monitoring environment and then transmit the data to an end user through multi-hop communication without the need for any human intervention. However, due to the presence of typical obstacles in a home environment, error-free reception may not be possible, particularly for power constrained devices. A mobile sink based data transmission scheme can be one solution but obstacles create significant complexities for the sink movement path determination process. Therefore, an obstacle avoidance data routing scheme is of vital importance to the design of an efficient home automation system. This paper presents a mobile sink based obstacle avoidance routing scheme for a home monitoring system. The mobile sink collects data by traversing through the obstacle avoidance path. Through ZigBee based hardware implementation and verification, the proposed scheme successfully transmits data through the obstacle avoidance path to improve network performance in terms of life span, energy consumption and reliability. The application of this work can be applied to a wide range of intelligent pervasive consumer products and services including robotic vacuum cleaners and personal security robots.},

	Abstract = {The use of wireless sensor networks in home automation (WSNHA) is a growing trend, on account of their self-organisation, low cost and potential for rapid deployment. Routing in WSNHA is a challenging research topic, because of the requirements of low energy consumption, low storage, low computational complexity, fast response, self-adaptation to unpredictable topological changes and robustness with respect to discontinuous interference. With the development of localisation techniques, localised routing offers a number of attractive benefits, but not all are suitable for WSNHA. In this study, the authors propose a new routing algorithm for WSNHA, called WSNHA-GAHR (greedy andA* heuristic routing for WSNHA). The algorithm uses greedy forwarding, based on the smallest Euclidean distance, to minimise the number of hops for data packet transmission, and thus conserve energy. It also automatically adjusts the route, using theA* heuristic algorithm, when local minimum problems and unpredictable topological changes occur in WSNHA. In addition, link priority classification gives WSNHA-GAHR a greater tolerance than ZigBee routing algorithm for discontinuous interference. Simulation results show that this routing protocol dramatically improves reliability and reduces average packet delay, without introducing additional overhead.},

	Abstract = {Ubiquitous monitoring over wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is of increasing interest in industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Question of how to understand a situation of physical system by estimating process parameters is largely unexplored. This paper is concerned with the distributed estimation problem for industrial automation over relay-assisted WSNs. Different from most existing works on WSN with homogeneous sensor nodes, the network considered in this paper consists of two types of nodes, i.e., sensing nodes (SNs), which is capable of sensing and computing, and relay nodes (RNs), which is only capable of simple data aggregation. We first adopt a Kalman filtering (KF) approach to estimate the unknown physical parameters. In order to facilitate the decentralized implementation of the KF algorithm in relay-assisted WSNs, a tree-based broadcasting strategy is provided for distributed sensor fusion. With the fused information, the consensus-based estimation algorithms are proposed for SNs and RNs, respectively. The proposed method is applied to estimate the slab temperature distribution in a hot rolling process monitoring system, which is a typical industrial CPS. It is demonstrated that the introduction of RNs improves temperature estimation efficiency and accuracy compared with the homogeneous WSN with SNs only.},

In this paper, the scheduling of packet transmission over wireless communication networks in CPS is studied for the purpose of system state stabilization. To measure the effective information amount of different packets, the concept of virtual queue (VQ) is defined based on the delay-tolerant Kalman filtering. VQ-based back pressure algorithm is proposed for the distributed data traffic scheduling. The impact of transmission delays on VQ lengths is also studied for the formulation of distributed scheduling strategy. The scheduling method is then applied in the context of voltage control in microgrid and is demonstrated to achieve better performance than general scheduling algorithm without the awareness of dynamics state. Further numerical simulations of data traffic scheduling considering transmission delay are carried out to demonstrate the validity of the scheduling algorithm, which is established according to VQ lengths affected by transmission time delays.},

	Abstract = {Robust network design against attacks is one of the most fundamental issues in Internet of Things (IoT) architecture as IoT operations highly rely on the support of the underlaying communication infrastructures. In this paper, the vulnerability of IoT infrastructure under intentional attacks is investigated by relating the network resilience to the percolation-based connectivity. Intentional attacks impose severe threats on the network operations as it can effectively disrupt a network by paralyzing a small fraction of nodes, and therefore deteriorating IoT operations. A fusion-based defense mechanism is proposed to mitigate the damage caused by such attacks, where each node feedbacks minimum (one-bit) local decision to the fusion center for attack inference. By formulating the attack and defense strategy as a zero-sum game, the outcome of the game equilibrium is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. The robustness of the Internet-oriented and the cyber-physical system (CPS)-oriented networks are specifically analyzed to illustrate the foundation of future IoT infrastructure. Both analytical and empirical results show that the proposed mechanism greatly enhances the robustness of IoT, even in the weak local detection capability and fragile network structure regime.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the development of a neuro-fuzzy agent for ambient-intelligence environments. The agent has been implemented as a system-on-chip (SoC) on a reconfigurable device, i.e., a field-programmable gate array. It is a hardware/software (HW/SW) architecture developed around a MicroBlaze processor (SW partition) and a set of parallel intellectual property cores for neuro-fuzzy modeling (HW partition). The SoC is an autonomous electronic device able to perform real-time control of the environment in a personalized and adaptive way, anticipating the desires and needs of its inhabitants. The scheme used to model the intelligent agent is a particular class of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system with piecewise multilinear behavior. The main characteristics of our model are computational efficiency, scalability, and universal approximation capability. Several online experiments have been performed with data obtained in a real ubiquitous computing environment test bed. Results obtained show that the SoC is able to provide high-performance control and adaptation in a life-long mode while retaining the modeling capabilities of similar agent-based approaches implemented on larger computing machines.},

	Abstract = {Home automation systems should evolve to the next phase in which they are aware of contexts, because providing services based on contexts will upgrade the service quality, thus making people more comfortable and home living more convenient. In particular, location is a piece of important and useful context information for seeking appropriate services, as well as providing them to people living in a home. So far, there have been several studies focused on tracking inhabitants in smart home environments. However, these approaches are often intrusive or require inhabitants to wear some sort of devices, which may make the inhabitants uncomfortable or even inconvenient. This problem could devastate the ultimate goal, which is to provide convenient services, and hence cause such approaches somewhat controversial. In this study, we utilize a number of load sensors together to construct a sensory floor on which exerted pressure can be detected and cover its surface with wooden flooring as in a normal home environment. Although the wooden flooring provides a flat surface for inhabitants to walk on, it also causes clutter in the sensor readings, which lead to difficulty in clearly identifying the location(s) of pressure source(s). Thus, we apply probabilistic data association technique and LeZi-Update approach to analyze the cluttered pressure readings collected by the load sensors so as to determine the positions of the inhabitants, as well as to track their movements. With our nonintrusive approach, there is no need for inhabitants to wear any devices, and this also solves the cross-walking problem in the home environment. Note to Practitioners-This system aims for detecting the location of multiple inhabitants in the home environment. We adopt the sensory floor as our tracking sensor, which consists of many blocks, each with a load cell to collect the human body weight. These blocks are covered with conventional wooden flooring to provide a flat surface on which inhabitants can walk freely. After collecting data, we apply mathematical techniques to analyze them, thus determining inhabitants' locations and tracking their movements. The limitation is that the system cannot differentiate different persons if they have close weight readings, which is the natural limitation of the load cell.},

	Abstract = {Identifying on-going activities for the provision of services that are capable of matching the needs of users poses a number of daunting challenges. Most existing approaches to activity recognition require training offline activity models before being applied to the identification of activities in real time. However, the dynamic nature of actual living environments can make previously learned activity models irrelevant. This study addressed the problem of learning and recognizing daily activities in a dynamic smart-home environment, using a novel approach referred to as hybrid user-assisted incremental model adaptation. This approach involves reconfiguring previously learned activity models within a dynamic environment, while pursuing maximum efficiency by using assistance from users as well as the system to annotate new training data. Experiments that are conducted in a fully equipped smart-home lab demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

	Abstract = {Online closed-loop hierarchical control systems (HCSs) are widely used in power-system operation. Like typical cyber-physical systems, the contingencies on the cyber side of an HCS may lead to inappropriate control commands, which will influence the physical power system. To evaluate the degree to which these inappropriate control commands influence the power system, we propose a cyber-physical equivalent model for HCSs. In this model, the HCS cyber network is abstracted to a directed graph consisting of data nodes and directed branches, and connectivity is described by using a node-branch incidence matrix. Using this strategy, we can describe the general information flow in an HCS using mathematical equations on the basis of which quantitative evaluation can be carried out. Furthermore, by using existing operation records, several kinds of typical cyber-contingencies are also modeled on the basis of which cyber-contingency assessment (cyber-CA) can be implemented by using a model-based approach. Considering the computational efficiency, such an approach keeps only key characteristics of the information flow rather than all features of the cyber network. In the case study, a coordinated secondary-voltage control system is studied as an example. The physical impacts of various cyber-contingencies on different data transmission and processing modules are compared. The results show that the model-based method provides improved efficiency compared with conventional simulation-based methods while maintaining accuracy.},

First, CPS with communication infrastructure is modeled as a hybrid system, in which the discrete system state is the mode of the communication infrastructure while the continuous system state is the state of the physical dynamics. The dynamical system can be considered as being switched among multiple modes corresponding to the discrete system state. Then, the communication infrastructure design is converted to the problems of mode provisioning and scheduling. This framework is applied in the context of smart grid as a special example of CPS and is shown to achieve good performance via numerical simulations.},

It means that a smart TV set-top box can be a good candidate to act as a hub that combines a wide variety of solutions for smart home services. This paper proposes a home appliance control framework based on a smart TV set-top box. As a core component, a home gateway software module is installed on the smart TV set-top box. And the architecture of the home gateway module is designed so that a home appliance control driver is installed only when necessary. To enable the user to control their home appliances in any place using a Web-based application or a Web browser, the proposed framework supports a WebSocket protocol-based data communication and comprises a Web server where each set-top box's network location is registered. The proposed framework is verified with a demonstration on a small-scale home model. Both IP-based and serial communication-based home appliances are included in the demonstration system. The demonstration examples show that consumers can control various types of home appliances in any place through a smart TV set-top box solution.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the state-of-the art dynamic sign language recognition (DSLR) system for smart home interactive applications. Our novel DSLR system comprises two main subsystems: an image processing (IP) module and a stochastic linear formal grammar (SLFG) module. Our IP module enables us to recognize the individual words of the sign language (i.e., a single gesture). In this module, we used the bag-of-features (BOFs) and a local part model approach for bare hand dynamic gesture recognition from a video. We used dense sampling to extract local 3-D multiscale whole-part features. We adopted 3-D histograms of a gradient orientation descriptor to represent features. The k-means++ method was applied to cluster the visual words. Dynamic hand gesture classification was conducted using the BOFs and nonlinear support vector machine methods. We used a multiscale local part model to preserve temporal context. The SLFG module analyzes the sentences of the sign language (i.e., sequences of gestures) and determines whether or not they are syntactically valid. Therefore, the DSLR system is not only able to rule out ungrammatical sentences, but it can also make predictions about missing gestures, which, in turn, increases the accuracy of our recognition task. Our IP module alone seals the accuracy of 97% and outperforms any existing bare hand dynamic gesture recognition system. However, by exploiting syntactic pattern recognition, the SLFG module raises this accuracy by 1.65%. This makes the aggregate performance of the DSLR system as accurate as 98.65%.},

	Abstract = {Smart grids are an evolution of the existing electric distribution systems due to the growing demand of energy, the expansion in the use of renewable energy sources, and the development of novel and innovative information and communication technologies (ICT). The installation of systems based on wireless networks can play a key role in the extension of the smart grid toward smart homes, that can be deemed as one of the most important components of smart grids. In fact, monitoring and control applications, energy harvesting, and innovative metering methodologies through smart wireless devices are becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel energy management approach for smart homes that combines a wireless network, based on bluetooth low energy (BLE), for communication among home appliances, with a home energy management (HEM) scheme. The proposed approach addresses the impact of standby appliances and high-power rating loads in peak hours to the energy consumption charges of consumers. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is efficient in terms of reducing peak load demand and electricity consumption charges with an increase in the comfort level of consumers.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses learning and recognition of human behavior models from multimodal observation in a smart home environment. The proposed approach is part of a framework for acquiring a high-level contextual model for human behavior in an augmented environment. A 3-D video tracking system creates and tracks entities (persons) in the scene. Further, a speech activity detector analyzes audio streams coming from head set microphones and determines for each entity, whether the entity speaks or not. An ambient sound detector detects noises in the environment. An individual role detector derives basic activity like ldquowalkingrdquo or ldquointeracting with tablerdquo from the extracted entity properties of the 3-D tracker. From the derived multimodal observations, different situations like ldquoaperitifrdquo or ldquopresentationrdquo are learned and detected using statistical models (HMMs). The objective of the proposed general framework is two-fold: the automatic offline analysis of human behavior recordings and the online detection of learned human behavior models. To evaluate the proposed approach, several multimodal recordings showing different situations have been conducted. The obtained results, in particular for offline analysis, are very good, showing that multimodality as well as multiperson observation generation are beneficial for situation recognition.},

The location information is then used to adjust the door phone camera position to frame the face in its field of view. In order to accurately locate the facial position of the visitor, 4 microphones are positioned in a cross configuration. Furthermore, face detection and face recognition algorithms as well as a wireless interface are used to recognize the visitor and send the information to the home owner's phone.

	Abstract = {Demand response (DR) is very important in the future smart grid, aiming to encourage consumers to reduce their demand during peak load hours. However, if binary decision variables are needed to specify start-up time of a particular appliance, the resulting mixed integer combinatorial problem is in general difficult to solve. In this paper, we study a versatile convex programming (CP) DR optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home. In particular, an L1 regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional L1 regularization term in the objective. This allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard CP problem. Its major advantage is that the overall DR optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently. Moreover, a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated. Simulation result shows that the energy scheduling of SAs and other appliances can be determined simultaneously using the proposed CP formulation.},

	Abstract = {The smart grid initiative and electricity market operation drive the development known as demand-side management or controllable load. Home energy management has received increasing interest due to the significant amount of loads in the residential sector. This paper presents a hardware design of smart home energy management system (SHEMS) with the applications of communication, sensing technology, and machine learning algorithm. With the proposed design, consumers can easily achieve a real-time, price-responsive control strategy for residential home loads such as electrical water heater (EWH), heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), electrical vehicle (EV), dishwasher, washing machine, and dryer. Also, consumers may interact with suppliers or load serving entities (LSEs) to facilitate the load management at the supplier side. Further, SHEMS is designed with sensors to detect human activities and then a machine learning algorithm is applied to intelligently help consumers reduce total payment on electricity without or with little consumer involvement. Finally, simulation and experiment results are presented based on an actual SHEMS prototype to verify the hardware system.},

While the industry is getting smarter about developing the wireless technologies and protocols needed (and thinking up innovative names for the options) it is clear that those at the cliff face of product and applications marketing face a major challenge in customer education.

	Abstract = {Power-line communications is a promising technology to help automate buildings, since it utilizes the in situ power cabling as a communications channel. However, couplers are required to inject and extract the communication signal from the power grid. Most power-line communications couplers make use of a small transformer to adapt impedance levels while also providing galvanic isolation. The cost and size of these transformers have been hindrances in the quest for compact, economic couplers. Previous attempts to eliminate this coupling transformer, while maintaining impedance adaptation, have not been successful in reducing component cost or physical size. In this paper, a novel approach is followed: 1) a suitable dual-function bandpass matching circuit is designed for ordinary electronics, whereafter 2) the specifications of this bandpass matching circuit are upgraded to function safely in the power-grid environment as a coupler. Therefore, a matching circuit is transformed into a compact power-line coupler, which further exhibits bandpass filtering and excellent impedance-adapting performance. Simulations as well as laboratory measurements are shown which confirm the accuracy of the design. Finally, practical 220-V measurements in an office block are presented, which prove the versatility of this novel coupler when power-grid conditions fluctuate.},

	Abstract = {Security issues in cyber-physical systems are of paramount importance due to the often safety-critical nature of its associated applications. A first step in understanding how to protect such systems requires an understanding of emergent weaknesses, in part, due to the cyber-physical coupling. In this paper, we present a framework that models a class of cyber-physical switching vulnerabilities in smart grid systems. Variable structure system theory is employed to effectively characterize the cyber-physical interaction of the smart grid and demonstrate how existence of the switching vulnerability is dependent on the local structure of the power grid. We identify and demonstrate how through successful cyber intrusion and local knowledge of the grid an opponent can compute and apply a coordinated switching sequence to a circuit breaker to disrupt operation within a short interval of time. We illustrate the utility of the attack approach empirically on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council three-machine, nine-bus system under both model error and partial state information.},

To overcome the radically different conceptions below these two specifications we define a new kind of application, coined as XbundLET, which acts as a bridge between both worlds allowing MHP applications to use the OSGi services and vice versa, i.e., allowing OSGi applications to take advantage of the MHP functionality. As a further step towards integrated residential gateways, we also propose a semantic description for OSGi services at the smart home that facilitates services discovery and invocation from broadcast MHP applications.},

	Abstract = {Increasing interest in smart home automation systems or home networks has driven the use of low-voltage power lines as a high-speed data channel. Since this type of power line is not designed for communication purposes, the channel exhibits unfavorable transmission properties. In this paper, a novel orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based physical-layer architecture for indoor broadband power-line communications is proposed. For the design of the layer, a new constellation for bit-mapping (or modulation) is introduced to increase the transmission rate over a sudden phase-shift-prone channel. In addition, a simple bit-loading scheme is adopted and a new preamble for a packet-based power-line communication system is proposed. The proposed layer is implemented as a type of testbed, and is field-tested in labs and in residential homes. The test results demonstrate that the proposed system has good channel adaptivity and achieves high transmission rates.},

	Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are heterogeneous, because they tightly couple computation, communication, and control along with physical dynamics, which are traditionally considered separately. Without a comprehensive modeling formalism, model-based development of CPS involves using a multitude of models in a variety of formalisms that capture various aspects of the system design, such as software design, networking design, physical models, and protocol design. Without a rigorous unifying framework, system integration and integration of the analysis results for various models remains ad hoc. In this paper, we propose a multi-view architecture framework that treats models as views of the underlying system structure and uses structural and semantic mappings to ensure consistency and enable system-level verification in a hierarchical and compositional manner. Throughout the paper, the theoretical concepts are illustrated using two examples: a quadrotor and an automotive intersection collision avoidance system.},

	Abstract = {One of the main problems in home networked systems is the wide diversity of technologies, application requirements and cost allowance for devices and systems in general. This is translated to a division into different islands of technology that goes down to single manufacturer systems, thus blocking the way to the system integration as the main reason for the existence of the network. It is widely accepted that achieving the interworking is the most important aspect of a system specification. Object-oriented modelling associated with proper application management mechanisms for trading and binding provides the best approach to standardisation work on home systems interworking. We take here as an example the work toward an interoperability specification for an energy management system. The system described spans several communication media and brings together several consumer and producer entities. The system aims to provide increased comfort while either minimising the usage of resources or their cost for the same level of usage. Results from installed and running systems show the success of the approach.},

Microgrid utilizes distributed renewable energy generation to reduce the burden on utility grids. This paper proposes an energy ecosystem; a cost-effective smart microgrid based on intelligent hierarchical agents with dynamic demand response (DR) and distributed energy resource (DER) management. With a dynamic update mechanism, DR automatically adapts to users' preference and varying external information. The DER management coordinates operations of micro combined heat and power systems ($\boldsymbol {\mu }$ CHPs), and vanadium redox battery (VRB) according to DR decisions. A two-level shared cost-led $\boldsymbol {\mu }$ CHPs management strategy is proposed to reduce energy consumption cost further. VRB discharging is managed to be environment-adaptive. Simulations and numerical results show the proposed system is very effective in reducing the energy consumption cost while satisfying user's preference.},

	Abstract = {As the number of computer-based systems and consumer gadgets is growing, users are becoming increasingly overwhelmed by the requests for attention coming from this variety of devices. In addition, technology has quickened the pace of life and work to the extent that interaction between people has become more frequent. Dealing with both social and device-driven interruptions has become one of the important goals of context-aware systems of today. This paper proposes a context-aware platform that can help mitigate the negative effects of interruptions in human work and living. The platform uses a scalable set of sensors to estimate user availability in the home or office environment. This information is announced to possible interrupters (e.g., household members and software application) by using a web portal, lighting effects, or interfaces to a home automation system or any other interested entity in the local network. This paper presents several contributions to the field. Platform architecture is considered scalable enough to fit to a variety of today's consumer devices and smart home systems. The experiments were conducted to show the effectiveness of the platform usage within a living room area, as opposed to the traditional office contexts where the availability tends to be easier to determine. The last contribution is related to the novel method and the evaluation of the use of lighting announcements of availability instead of the traditional inefficient busy flags.},

	Abstract = {The quality-of-life of leg amputees can be improved dramatically by using a cyber-physical system (CPS) that controls artificial legs based on neural signals representing amputees' intended movements. The key to the CPS is the neural-machine interface (NMI) that senses electromyographic (EMG) signals to make control decisions. This paper presents a design and implementation of a novel NMI using an embedded computer system to collect neural signals from a physical system-a leg amputee, provide adequate computational capability to interpret such signals, and make decisions to identify user's intent for prostheses control in real time. A new deciphering algorithm, composed of an EMG pattern classifier and a postprocessing scheme, was developed to identify the user's intended lower limb movements. To deal with environmental uncertainty, a trust management mechanism was designed to handle unexpected sensor failures and signal disturbances. Integrating the neural deciphering algorithm with the trust management mechanism resulted in a highly accurate and reliable software system for neural control of artificial legs. The software was then embedded in a newly designed hardware platform based on an embedded microcontroller and a graphic processing unit (GPU) to form a complete NMI for real-time testing. Real-time experiments on a leg amputee subject and an able-bodied subject have been carried out to test the control accuracy of the new NMI. Our extensive experiments have shown promising results on both subjects, paving the way for clinical feasibility of neural controlled artificial legs.},

	Abstract = {Ambient-assisted living (AAL) is currently one of the important research and development areas, where accessibility, usability, and learning play a major role and where future interfaces are an important concern for applied engineering. The general goal of AAL solutions is to apply ambient intelligence technology to enable people with specific demands, e.g., handicapped or elderly, to live in their preferred environment longer. The term ``Internet of Things'' (IoT) is used as an umbrella keyword for covering various aspects related to the extension of the Internet and the Web into the physical realm, by means of the widespread deployment of spatially distributed devices with embedded identification, sensing and/or actuation capabilities. In this context, we propose a new methodology based on self organizing maps (SOMs) and fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithms for profile generation as regards the activities of the user and their correlation with the available sensors. Moreover, we utilize the provided context to assign the generated profiles to more contextually complex activities. Our methodology is being evaluated into an AAL structure equipped with several sensors. More precisely, we assess the proposed method in a data set generated by accelerometers and its performance over a number of everyday activities.},

	Abstract = {Services in ambient intelligence (AmI) environments should adapt to contextual information (context-aware) of users and environment in a nonintrusive and natural way. Location-aware, i.e., the user location, is one of the most important pieces in context-aware. According to this premise, a location-based service (LBS) using radio frequency identification technology is presented. The service is based on hidden Markov models for location within an intelligent building. This problem leads to a multiobjective optimization problem, in which, the best configuration of antennas that minimizes the set of antennas but maximizes the precision of the prediction should be found. Specifically, this study presents a memetic approach for multiobjective improvement of LBS in AmI environments. The memetic algorithm provides, in this problem, the exploitation of domain knowledge and the combination of metaheuristics. Experimental results show that the approach obtains a configuration of antennas which optimally configures the number and position of the antennas while keeping a high quality of the precision of the location prediction.},

	Abstract = {The remote control seems to epitomise how we relax at home in the modern environment, so much that we take the humble little box of electronics for granted. Virtually all of the audio and video devices in the home can be controlled by remote. However, despite many efforts by home-automation enthusiasts, extending the remote realm beyond these entertainment devices has been less successful. The extension of remote control functionality throughout the average dwelling requires the engagement of a custom installation company, which will for a price enable all your white goods, brown goods, lights, curtains, and garage doors to be controlled by a single box of tricks. The modern reality of course is that we all have a handful of remotes jostling for position on our chair arms. The one drawback when we do finally slump down after a hard day's work, is the inevitable fumble down the side of the sofa for the right remote. Not only this, but they all look the same. And when you finally chance upon the right one, the complexity of modern electrical hardware means the buttons are numerous, tiny and covered in unfathomable iconography.},

	Abstract = {The context-aware service system (CASS) for smart home services has received considerable attention due to advances made in context-awareness technologies. In recent years, various context-aware consumer electronics for intelligent and personalized user-centric services have been introduced. However, the conventional CASS has architectural limitations, including low availability, low interoperability, and low scalability. For example, it is difficult to modify or update the context-aware service (CAS) infrastructure once it has been built. Therefore, this paper proposes a zone-aware service system (ZASS) for cost-effective pervasive infrastructure. The main component of the ZASS is a zone-aware service agent (ZASA) which utilizes the user's nomadic resource as a sensor or gateway. The term `user's nomadic resource' refers to the user's hand-held device, which has a sensing or networking capability, such as a smartphone, smart watch, and mobile sensor, etc. As the utilization of the user's nomadic resource, the ZASS can be cost-effectively implemented compared with the conventional CASS. The performance of the proposed system is discussed via a simple smart home service scenario. The experimental result showed that the proposed system can reduce the power consumption of an air conditioner by 20.7%.},

	Abstract = {Vehicular Cyber-Physical System (VCPS) provides CPS services via exploring the sensing, computing and communication capabilities on vehicles. VCPS is deeply influenced by the performance of the underlying vehicular network with intermittent connections, which make existing routing solutions hardly to be applied directly. Epidemic routing, especially the one using random linear network coding, has been studied and proved as an efficient way in the consideration of delivery performance. Much pioneering work has tried to figure out how epidemic routing using network coding (ERNC) performs in VCPS, either by simulation or by analysis. However, none of them has been able to expose the potential of ERNC accurately. In this paper, we present a stochastic analytical framework to study the performance of ERNC in VCPS with intermittent connections. By novelly modeling ERNC in VCPS using a token-bucket model, our framework can provide a much more accurate results than any existing work on the unicast delivery performance analysis of ERNC in VCPS. The correctness of our analytical results has also been confirmed by our extensive simulations.},

@article{6748053,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we develop a comprehensive real-time interactive framework for the utility and customers in a smart grid while ensuring grid-stability and quality-of-service (QoS). First, we propose a hierarchical architecture for the utility-customer interaction consisting of sub-components of customer load prediction, renewable generation integration, power-load balancing and demand response (DR). Within this hierarchical architecture, we focus on the problem of real-time scheduling in an abstract grid model consisting of one controller and multiple customer units. A scalable solution to the real-time scheduling problem is proposed by combining solutions to two sub-problems: (1) centralized sequential decision making at the controller to maximize an accumulated reward for the whole micro-grid and (2) distributed auctioning among all customers based on the optimal load profile obtained by solving the first problem to coordinate their interactions. We formulate the centralized sequential decision making at the controller as a hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP). Next, a Vikrey auctioning game is designed to coordinate the actions of the individual smart-homes to actually achieve the optimal solution derived by the controller under realistic gird interaction assumptions. We show that though truthful bidding is a weakly dominant strategy for all smart-homes in the auctioning game, collusive equilibria do exist and can jeopardize the effectiveness and efficiency of the trading opportunity allocation. Analysis on the structure of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution set shows that the Vickrey auctioning game can be made more robust against collusion by customers (anticipating distributed smart-homes) by introducing a positive reserve price. The corresponding auctioning game is then shown to converge to the unique incentive compatible truthful bidding Bayesian Nash equilibrium, without jeopardizing the auctioneer's (microgrid controller's) profit. The paper also explicitly discusses how this two-step solution approach can be scaled to be suitable for more complicated smart grid architectures beyond the assumed abstract model.},

	Abstract = {We address the problem of estimating the number of people in a room using information available in standard HVAC systems. We propose an estimation scheme based on two phases. In the first phase, we assume the availability of pilot data and identify a model for the dynamic relations occurring between occupancy levels, CO2concentration and room temperature. In the second phase, we make use of the identified model to formulate the occupancy estimation task as a deconvolution problem. In particular, we aim at obtaining an estimated occupancy pattern by trading off between adherence to the current measurements and regularity of the pattern. To achieve this goal, we employ a special instance of the so-called fused lasso estimator, which promotes piecewise constant estimates by including an ℓ1norm-dependent term in the associated cost function. We extend the proposed estimator to include different sources of information, such as actuation of the ventilation system and door opening/closing events. We also provide conditions under which the occupancy estimator provides correct estimates within a guaranteed probability. We test the estimator running experiments on a real testbed, in order to compare it with other occupancy estimation techniques and assess the value of having additional information sources. Note to Practitioners - Home automation systems benefit from automatic recognition of human presence in the built environment. Since dedicated hardware is costly, it may be preferable to detect occupancy with software-based systems which do not require the installation of additional devices. The object of this study is the reconstruction of occupancy patterns in a room using measurements of concentration, temperature, fresh air inflow, and door opening/closing events. All these signals are information sources often available in HVAC systems of modern buildings and homes. We assess the value of such information sources in terms of their relevance in detecting occupancy in small and medium-sized rooms. The proposed estimation scheme is composed of two distinct phases. The first is a training phase where the goal is to derive a mathematical model relating the number of occupants with the concentration. It is required to record the actual occupants in the room for a time period spanning few days, a task that can be performed either with manual logging or with temporary dedicated hardware counting systems. In a second phase, we use the derived model to design an online software which collects measurements of the environmental signals and provides the number of people currently in the room. The estimated occupancy levels can then be employed to enhance the efficiency of the HVAC system of the building. We notice that, in modern residential buildings composed by structurally equal flats, the training phase can be run in one flat only, since the obtained model will be reasonably valid for the other flats.},

	Abstract = {Despite the rapid advancements in consumer electronics, the data transmitted by sensing devices in a smart home environment are still vulnerable to anomalies due to node faults, transmission errors, or attacks. This affects the reliability of the received sensed data and may lead to the incorrect decision making at both local (i.e., smart home) and global (i.e., smart city) levels. This study introduces a novel mobile agent-based cross-layer anomaly detection scheme, which takes into account stochastic variability in cross-layer data obtained from received data packets, and defines fuzzy logic-based soft boundaries to characterize behavior of sensor nodes. This cross-layer design approach empowers the proposed scheme to detect both node and link anomalies, and also effectively transmits mobile agents by considering the communication link-state before transmission of the mobile agent. The proposed scheme is implemented on a real testbed and a modular application software is developed to manage the anomaly detection system in the smart home. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme detects cross-layer anomalies with high accuracy and considerably reduces the energy consumption caused by the mobile agent transmission in the poor communication link-state situations.},

	Abstract = {We propose a home network architecture, which integrates heterogeneous home network environments. Our architecture incorporates various home network technologies into the gateway technology. We use link-layer dependent protocols within a single network communication, and, in contrast, we use the gateway technology when the communication is over multiple networks. We also propose home gateway architectures, which are the key component of the residential network. The home gateway interconnects the home networks and the public (access) network. We show the requirements of the home gateway and its software design. We implemented the experimental home gateway system, which is based on the Web server enhanced with Java facilities. The home gateway interconnects the Internet on the public network side, and the home networks (IEEE 1394 AV network and the home automation power line network). It also has a real-time MPEG4 transcoding function which transcodes AV data on IEEE1394 into MPEG4 video that is suitable for transmitting through the Internet. The home gateway provides the capability of remote control of the connected appliances on the home networks from the Internet, and the AV data transmission/translation capabilities.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present an initial study to develop fault detection and isolation techniques for the vehicle systems that are controlled by a network of electronic control units (ECUs). The root causes of the faults include hardware components such as actuators, software within the controllers (ECUs), or the interactions between hardware and software, i.e., between controllers and plants. These faults, originating from various interactions and especially between hardware and software, are particularly challenging to address. Our basic strategy is to divide the fault universe of the cyber-physical system in a hierarchical manner, and monitor the critical variables/signals that have impact at different levels of interactions. Diagnostic matrix is established to represent the relationship between the faults and the test outcomes (also known as fault signatures). A factorial hidden Markov model-based inference algorithm, termed dynamic multiple fault diagnosis, is used to infer the root causes based on the observed test outcomes. The proposed diagnostic strategy is validated on an electrical power generation and storage system controlled by two ECUs in an environment with CANoe/MATLAB co-simulation. Eleven faults are injected with the failures originating in actuator hardware, sensor, controller hardware, and software components (sensor faults are not considered in this paper). The simulation results show that the proposed diagnostic strategy is effective in addressing the interaction-caused faults.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a home automation system using a PDA(Personal Digital Assistants)-based intelligent robot system architecture which consists of three layers; a user layer, a manager layer, and an action layer. In the user layer, users manage and control the robot, and get visual information via the remote monitoring system. In the case of showing maps with the status of the robot, synchronization is very important. In the manager layer, there are three parts; a server part, a home appliances part, and a storage part. The server part manages all the status information of the house, the home appliances part controls all appliances, and the storage system stores all the status information of the house. In the action layer, the main robot system uses a PDA instead of a computer. As a PDA has limited performance, simple algorithms are required. It has an intelligent functional engine for SLAM(Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) and vision processing. We have developed the PDA-based mobile robot system for home automation based on this architecture in order to verify its efficiency.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a system that allows recognizing a person's emotional state starting from audio signal registrations. The provided solution is aimed at improving the interaction among humans and computers, thus allowing effective human-computer intelligent interaction. The system is able to recognize six emotions(anger, boredom, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) and the neutral state. This set of emotional states is widely used for emotion recognition purposes. It also distinguishes a single emotion versus all the other possible ones, as proven in the proposed numerical results. The system is composed of two subsystems: 1) gender recognition(GR) and 2) emotion recognition(ER). The experimental analysis shows the performance in terms of accuracy of the proposed ER system. The results highlight that the a priori knowledge of the speaker's gender allows a performance increase. The obtained results show also that the features selection adoption assures a satisfying recognition rate and allows reducing the employed features. Future developments of the proposed solution may include the implementation of this system over mobile devices such as smartphones.},

These features are then fed into a directed acyclic graph support vector machine for posture classification, the result of which is then combined with derived floor information to detect a fall. From a dataset of 15 people, we show that our fall detection system can achieve a high fall detection rate (97.08%) and a very low false detection rate (0.8%) in a simulated home environment.},

	Abstract = {Existing home-networking protocols do not robustly incorporate universal connectivity among multiple homes, which leaves their use restricted to a single home. In addition, even in a single home network, new functional requirements ask for more diversified forms of networking control. This paper presents in-home consumer electronic devices that incorporate the emerging SDN (Software Defined Networking) paradigm. The proposed devices enable ondemand provisioning for protocol-agnostic home networking and thus provide a high degree of flexibility for intra-home networking as well as wider connectivity for inter-home networking. The feasibility of the prototype devices is verified by realizing a multi-home visual-sharing scenario and by supporting diverse future scenarios.},

	Abstract = {Evolvability is essential for computer systems to adapt to the dynamic and changing requirements in response to instant or delayed feedback from a service environment that nowadays is becoming more and more context aware; however, current context-aware service-centric models largely lack the capability to continuously explore human intentions that often drive system evolution. To support service requirements analysis of real-world applications for services computing, this paper presents a situation-theoretic approach to human-intention-driven service evolution in context-aware service environments. In this study, we give situation a definition that is rich in semantics and useful for modeling and reasoning human intentions, whereas the definition of intention is based on the observations of situations. A novel computational framework is described that allows us to model and infer human intentions by detecting the desires of an individual as well as capturing the corresponding context values through observations. An inference process based on hidden Markov model makes instant definition of individualized services at runtime possible, and significantly, shortens service evolution cycle. We illustrate the possible applications of this framework through a smart home example aimed at supporting independent living of elderly people.},

Visualization prototypes developed in this way prove effective in a situation whereby data sets are largely unknown and requirements open - enabling successful exploration of possibilities for visualization in Smart Home data analysis. The process gives rise to novel designs and design metaphors including data sculpting. It suggests: that the deliberate use of creativity techniques with data stakeholders is likely to contribute to successful, novel and effective solutions; that being explicit about creativity may contribute to designers developing creative solutions; that using creativity techniques early in the design process may result in a creative approach persisting throughout the process. The work constitutes the first systematic visualization design for a data rich source that will be increasingly important to energy suppliers and consumers as Smart Meter technology is widely deployed. It is novel in explicitly employing creativity techniques at the requirements stage of visualization design and development, paving the way for further use and study of creativity methods in visualization design.},

Here, an opponent is able to remotely control multiple circuit breakers within a power system, say through data corruption or communication network attack, to destabilize target synchronous generators through application of state-dependent breaker switching. In contrast to attack via a single breaker, the multi-switch case provides additional degrees of freedom that can lead to stealthier and wide-scale cascading failures. We provide a dynamical systems context for formulating distributed multi-switch strategies and execute such attacks on the New England 10-generator 39-bus test system.},

The overall system dynamics emerges from the interaction among physical dynamics, computational dynamics, and communication networks. Network uncertainties such as time-varying delay and packet loss cause significant challenges. This paper proposes a passive control architecture for designing NCS that are insensitive to network uncertainties. We describe the architecture for a system consisting of a robotic manipulator controlled by a digital controller over a wireless network and show that the system is stable even in the presence of time-varying delays. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the passivity-based architecture with respect to stability and performance and show that the system is insensitive to network uncertainties.},

	Abstract = {Buildings with shared spaces such as corporate office buildings, university dorms, etc., are occupied by multiple occupants who typically have different temperature preferences. Attaining a common temperature set-point that is agreeable to all users (occupants) in such a multi-occupant space is a challenging problem. Furthermore, the ideal temperature set-point should optimally trade off the building energy cost with the aggregate discomfort of all the occupants. However, the information on the comfort range (function) is held privately by each occupant. Using occupant-differentiated dynamically-adjusted penalty factor as feedback signals, we propose a distributed solution which ensures that a consensus is attained among all occupants upon convergence, irrespective of their ideal temperature preferences being in coherence or conflicting. Occupants are only assumed to be rational, in that they choose their own temperature set-points so as to minimize their individual energy cost plus discomfort. We establish the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal temperature set-point vector that minimizes the sum of the energy cost and the aggregate discomfort of all occupants in a multizone building. Simulations with realistic parameter settings illustrate validation of our theoretical claims and provide insights on the dynamics of the system with a mobile user population.},

	Abstract = {Etched Fiber Bragg Grating (EFBG) sensors are attractive from the point of the inherently high multiplexing ability of fiber based sensors. However, the strong dependence of the sensitivity of EFBG sensors on the fiber diameter requires robust methods for calibration when used for distributed sensing in a large array format. Using experimental data and numerical modelling, we show that knowledge of the wavelength shift during the etch process is necessary for high-fidelity calibration of EFBG arrays. However as this approach requires the monitoring of every element of the sensor array during etching, we also proposed and demonstrated a calibration scheme using data from bulk refractometry measurements conducted post-fabrication without needing any information about the etching process. Although this approach is not as precise as the first one, it may be more practical as there is no requirement to monitor each element of the sensor array. We were able to calibrate the response of the sensors to within 3% with the approach using information acquired during etching and to within 5% using the post-fabrication bulk refractometry approach in spite of the sensitivities of the array element differing by more than a factor of 4. These two approaches present a tradeoff between accuracy and practicality.},

	Abstract = {While Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors have been extensively used for temperature and strain sensing, clad etched FBGs (EFBGs) have only recently been explored for refractive index sensing. Prior literature in EFBG based refractive index sensing predominantly deals with bulk refractometry only, where the Bragg wavelength shift of the sensor as a function of the bulk refractive index of the sample can be analytically modeled, unlike the situation for adsorption of molecular thin films on the sensor surface. We used a finite element model to calculate the Bragg wavelength change as a function of thickness and refractive index of the adsorbing molecular layer and compared the model with the real-time, in-situ measurement of electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of weak polyelectrolytes on the silica surface of EFBGs. We then used this model to calculate the layer thickness of LbL films and found them to be in agreement with literature. Further, we used this model to arrive at a realistic estimate of the limit of detection of EFBG sensors based on nominal measurement noise levels in current FBG interrogation systems and found that sufficiently thinned EFBGs can provide a competitive platform for real-time measurement of molecular interactions while simultaneously leveraging the high multiplexing capabilities of fiber optics.},

	Abstract = {As computers continue to advance, they are becoming more capable of sensing, interacting, and communicating with the physical and cyber world. Medical devices, electronic braking systems in automotive applications, and industrial control systems are examples of the many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that utilize these computing capabilities. Given the potential consequences of software related failures in such systems, a high degree of safety, security, and reliability is often required. Programming languages are important tools used by programmers to develop CPS. They provide a programmer with the ability to transform designs into machine code. Of equal importance is their ability to detect and avoid programming mistakes. The development of CPS has predominantly been accomplished using the C programming language. Although C is a powerful language, it lacks features present in other languages that facilitate the development of reliable systems. This has prompted research into language-based alternatives for improving program quality through the use of programming languages. This paper presents an overview of the characteristics of embedded and cyber-physical systems and the associated requirements imposed on programming languages. This is followed by a survey of relevant research into language-based methods for creating safe, reliable, and robust software for CPS.},

	Abstract = {Smart homes, as active participants in a smart grid, may no longer be modeled by passive load curves; because their interactive communication and bidirectional power flow within the smart grid affects demand, generation, and electricity rates. To consider such dynamic environmental properties, we use a multiagent-system-based approach in which individual homes are autonomous agents making rational decisions to buy, sell, or store electricity based on their present and expected future amount of load, generation, and storage, accounting for the benefits each decision can offer. In the proposed scheme, home agents prioritize their decisions based on the expected utilities they provide. Smart homes' intention to minimize their electricity bills is in line with the grid's aim to flatten the total demand curve. With a set of case studies and sensitivity analyses, we show how the overall performance of the home agents converges-as an emergent behavior-to an equilibrium benefiting both the entities in different operational conditions and determines the situations in which conventional homes would benefit from purchasing their own local generation-storage systems.},

The objective of this work is to perform a comparative analysis of message passing versus shared memory as programming models for single-chip multiprocessor platforms. Our analysis is carried out from a hardware-software viewpoint: we carefully tune hardware architectures and software libraries for each programming model.

	Abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate discrete-time computing and continuous-time physical-world entities, which are often wirelessly interlinked. The use of wireless safety-critical CPS requires safety guarantees despite communication faults. This paper focuses on one important set of such safety rules: Proper-Temporal-Embedding (PTE), where distributed CPS entities must enter/leave risky states according to properly nested temporal pattern and certain duration spacing. Our solution introduces hybrid automata to formally describe and analyze CPS design patterns. We propose a novel leasing based design pattern, along with closed-form configuration constraints, to guarantee PTE safety rules under arbitrary wireless communication faults. We propose a formal procedure to transform the design pattern hybrid automata into specific wireless CPS designs. This procedure can effectively isolate physical world parameters from affecting the PTE safety of the resultant specific designs. We conduct two wireless CPS case studies, one on medicine and the other on control, to show that the resulted system is safe against communication failures. We also compare our approach with a polling based approach. Both approaches support PTE under arbitrary communication failures. The polling approach performs better under severely adverse wireless medium conditions; while ours performs better under benign or moderately adverse wireless medium conditions.},

	Abstract = {The major design challenge in developing intelligent home network services is to organize effectively distributed and heterogeneous home devices. This article considers a mobile agent space based multi-agent architecture to meet this challenge. MASSIHN is a home network system that links consumer electronics and computing devices. The proposed Java based MASSIHN with mobile agents, may change the management functionality and the type of information collected to control various home network devices. MASSIHN supports TCP/IP, and can obtain data from MASS (mobile agent space system), encode the data into an XML document and then transfer the XML document to the server at the monitoring and management center. The end-users of MASSIHN can modify the parameters that govern their home appliances, and monitor their most recent home service states via the Internet from anywhere at any time. The business partners of MASSIHN can provide their customers with Internet services without constructing the backbone of a network, greatly reducing service cost. The proposed approach can execute MASSIHN applications from several commonly used devices such as PDAs and laptops.},

	Abstract = {Traditional wheeled robots cannot easily adapt to complex home environments with stairs and doorsills. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel wireless sensor network based home security system with a modular self-reconfigurable robot (Transmote) as the mobile node. The security system is composed of some static monitoring nodes, a Transmote, and a home server. Static nodes with pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor and digital camera are mounted on doorframes and windows to detect intruders and send intrusion alarm messages to the home server. Transmote with PIR sensor and camera can patrol in the house for security surveillance. Transmote also can provide network repairing service when some static router nodes fail. Transmote modules and static monitoring nodes are controlled by two different wireless sensor networks. The remote house owner can get the alarm messages through Internet. Transmote can transform into I-shaped or O-shaped configuration according to different locomotion requirements. A prototype system has been implemented and some performance tests have been done. Experimental results show that the I-shaped Transmote can pass through an 8.8 cm high and 10 cm wide channel. The velocity of the I-shaped Transmote is up to 3 m/min and the maximum velocity of O-shaped Transmote is 9.3 m/min. A 12 kB captured photo can be transmitted to the gateway through 15 hops without any packet loss.},

	Abstract = {The duration of a sit-to-stand (SiSt) transfer is a representative measure of a person's status of physical mobility. This paper measured the duration unobtrusively and automatically using a pressure sensor array under a bed mattress and a floor plate beside the bed. Pressure sequences were extracted from frames of sensor data measuring bed and floor pressure over time. The start time was determined by an algorithm based on the motion of the center of pressure (COP) on the mattress toward the front edge of the bed. The end time was determined by modeling the foot pressure exerted on the floor in the wavelet domain as the step response of a third-order transfer function. As expected, young and old healthy adults generated shorter SiSt durations of around 2.31 and 2.88 s, respectively, whereas post-hip fracture and post-stroke adults produced longer SiSt durations of around 3.32 and 5.00 s. The unobtrusive nature of pressure sensing techniques used in this paper provides valuable information that can be used for the ongoing monitoring of patients within extended-care facilities or within the smart home environment.},

SPEED is a variant of the sequence prediction algorithm. It works with the episodes of smart home events that have been extracted based on the on -off states of home appliances. An episode is a set of sequential user activities that periodically occur in smart homes. The extracted episodes are processed and arranged in a finite-order Markov model. A method based on prediction by partial matching (PPM) algorithm is applied to predict the next activity from the previous history. The result shows that SPEED achieves an 88.3% prediction accuracy, which is better than LeZi Update, Active LeZi, IPAM, and C4.5.},

	Abstract = {For practical multimedia streaming services in home networks, seamless binding between two stream formats (digital video (DV) and MPEG-4), on two heterogeneous protocols (IEEE 1394 and Ethernet), is required. IEEE 1394 is the best way for the real-time transmission of high bandwidth audio/video (A/V) content inside a home, and Ethernet provides a connection to anywhere, not only in homes, but also outside by using wired or wireless mobile solutions, however, because of differences between the two stream solutions (DV-IEEE 1394 and MPEG-4-Ethernet), an appropriate device or function is needed between the two parts. In this paper, the software and hardware architecture of a media gateway are suggested in order to solve the problems. First, hardware architecture was designed to support transcoding functions between DV and MPEG-4 in real-time. It also solves resource limitations between two protocols and related devices such as bandwidth and quality factors. Suggested software architecture coordinates the heterogeneity of transaction management and addressing mechanisms between two protocols. Based on the design requirements of the proposed system, we implemented a prototype media gateway based on the proposed architecture and the performance was evaluates being successful.},

HPC has seen the maturation of cluster computing, the advent of multi-core computing, the creation of grid and cloud computing, and the sudden rise of the graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose computing. These changes have also been coupled with the slow ending of Moore's law. Electric power systems have also undergone many changes including the introduction of the advanced metering infrastructure and other advanced technologies for data collection, the inclusion of renewable/distributed power generation, and the addition of electric vehicles as stochastic loads. Clear goals have also been set for the development of the smart grid-a unique cyber-physical system (CPS) that requires the interaction of the electric power system and HPC. As such, this work explores the many ways in which HPC will be used in the smart grid and its CPS in the future including real-time and off-line analysis, data mining/storage, intelligent coordination, security, simulation, and visualization.},

	Abstract = {Demand response (DR) programs are implemented to encourage consumers to reduce their electricity demand when needed, e.g., at peak-load hours, by adjusting their controllable load. In this paper, our focus is on controllable load types that are associated with dynamic systems and can be modeled using differential equations. Examples of such load types include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; water heating; and refrigeration. In this regard, we propose a new DR model based on a two-level differential game framework. At the beginning of each DR interval, the price is decided by the upper level (aggregator, utility, or market) given the total demand of users in the lower level. At the lower level, for each player (residential or commercial buildings that are equipped with automated load control systems and local renewable generators), given the price from the upper level, the electricity usage of air conditioning unit, and the battery storage charging/discharging schedules, are controlled in order to minimize the user's total electricity cost. The optimal user strategies are derived using the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We also show that the proposed game can converge to a feedback Nash equilibrium. Based on the effect of real-time pricing on users' daily demand profile, the simulation results demonstrate the properties of the proposed game and show how we can optimize consumers' electricity cost in the presence of time-varying prices.},

	Abstract = {Infrastructural systems such as the electricity grid, healthcare, and transportation networks today rely increasingly on the joint functioning of networked information systems and physical components, in short, on cyber-physical architectures. Despite tremendous advances in cryptography, physical-layer security and authentication, information attacks, both passive such as eavesdropping, and active such as unauthorized data injection, continue to thwart the reliable functioning of networked systems. In systems with joint cyber-physical functionality, the ability of an adversary to monitor transmitted information or introduce false information can lead to sensitive user data being leaked or result in critical damages to the underlying physical system. This paper investigates two broad challenges in information security in cyber-physical systems (CPSs): preventing retrieval of internal physical system information through monitored external cyber flows, and limiting the modification of physical system functioning through compromised cyber flows. A rigorous analytical framework grounded on information-theoretic security is developed to study these challenges in a general stochastic control system abstraction-a theoretical building block for CPSs-with the objectives of quantifying the fundamental tradeoffs between information security and physical system performance, and through the process, designing provably secure controller policies. Recent results are presented that establish the theoretical basis for the framework, in addition to practical applications in timing analysis of anonymous systems, and demand response systems in a smart electricity grid.},

The proposed framework combines control-theoretic methods, information security notions and computational models to characterize tradeoffs among different design and operation objectives. We quantify the intricate relation among control performance, system security and platform schedulability through a minimal set of interface variables. We argue that security mechanisms and control algorithms need to be codesigned and comanaged with the embedded platform, so as to avoid the design of algorithms that are too expensive to implement on the embedded platform, or significantly impede design objectives such as performance and timing robustness.},

	Abstract = {Video-based human activity recognition systems have potential contributions to various applications such as smart homes and healthcare services. In this work, we present a novel depth video-based translation and scaling invariant human activity recognition (HAR) system utilizing R transformation of depth silhouettes. To perform HAR in indoor settings, an invariant HAR method is critical to freely perform activities anywhere in a camera view without translation and scaling problems of human body silhouettes. We obtain such invariant features via R transformation on depth silhouettes. Furthermore, in R transforming depth silhouettes, shape information of human body reflected in depth values is encoded into the features. In R transformation, 2D feature maps are computed first through Radon transform of each depth silhouette followed by computing 1D feature profile through R transform to get the translation and scaling invariant features. Then, we apply Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to make the features more prominent, compact and robust. Finally, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to train and recognize different human activities. Our proposed system shows superior recognition rate over the conventional approaches, reaching up to the mean recognition rate of 93.16% for six typical human activities whereas the conventional PC and IC-based depth silhouettes achieved only 74.83% and 86.33% ,while binary silhouettes-based R transformation approach achieved 67.08% respectively.

	Abstract = {In recent years, smart grids have been a common interest for many consumers, because of their comfort, safety, robustness, and economic characteristics. This paper presents the development of a computational tool, as an adaptive cognition system for smart grids, having smart homes as their composing nodes. Such a tool has been named Smart Home Energy Aware-Preserver (SHEAP). SHEAP incorporates evolutionary computation algorithms, and communication protocols, to provide users with context awareness and fault tolerance. Moreover, SHEAP considers a smart home powered by solar and wind energy, as a small version of the smart grid. SHEAP demonstrates the benefits of having a smart home that can control the amount of power needed, according to the context of usage. Furthermore, SHEAP includes fault tolerant mechanisms to monitor and react on fault occurrences. Simulation shows that with a smart control of the load, the requirements for a green energy system are reduced. An economic analysis of the approach demonstrates the viability of the project reducing the usage of grid energy by utilizing green energy.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe an approach to the analysis and design of power grid dynamic performance based on hybrid systems theory. Power grid is a large-scale cyber-physical system for transmission of electrical energy. The joint dynamics of physical processes and cyber elements in power grids are typical of a mixture of continuous and discrete behaviors, that is, hybrid dynamics. We address problems on stability that are basic concerns in the performance of current and future power grids with the hybrid dynamics. Measures for stability of power grids are interpreted as safety specifications in hybrid system models and are translated into restrictions on the systems' reachable sets of states. Algorithmic reachability analysis of hybrid systems enables analysis of safe initial states and hence quantitative estimation of stability regions. Also it contributes to synthesis of safe initial states as well as switching conditions in order to satisfy safety specifications in a power grid. We demonstrate the approach for two problems on transient stability of the single machine/infinite bus (SMIB) system and on fault release control of a multimachine power grid.},

IP address lookup in routers is an essential operation that should be performed in real-time for routers where hundreds of million packets arrive per second. In this paper, we propose a new software-based architecture for efficient IP address lookup. In the proposed scheme, a large routing table is divided into multiple balanced trees, and sequential binary searches are performed on those trees, and hence the number of memory accesses depends on the number of routing entries not on the length of routing prefixes. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed architecture requires a single 301.7 Kbyte SRAM to store about 41000 routing entries, and an address lookup is achieved by 11 memory accesses in average.},

	Abstract = {The need for energy efficient and intelligent systemic solutions, has lead many researchers around the world to investigate and evaluate the existing technologies in order to create solutions that would be adopted for the near future intelligent homes and buildings, aiding in smart grid initiatives. In this paper an algorithm based on the adaptable learning system principles is presented. The proposed algorithm utilizes the adaptable learning system concepts. The Observe, Learn, and Adapt (OLA) algorithm proposed is the result of integration of wireless sensors and artificial intelligence concepts towards the same objective: adding more intelligence to a programmable communicating thermostat (PCT), for better energy management and conservation in smart homes. A house simulator was developed and used as an ``expert system shell'' to assist in implementation and verification of the OLA algorithm. The role of PCT is to provide consumer with a means to manage and reduce energy use, while accommodating their every day schedules, preferences and needs. In this paper, the actual results of learning and adaptability of a PCT equipped with OLA, as a result of the occupant's pattern/schedule changes, and in general, the overall system improvements with respect to energy consumption and savings are demonstrated via simulation for the zone controlled home equipped with OLA and Knowledge Base, versus a home without zone control, Knowledge Base nor OLA.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the state estimation problem in cyber-physical systems (CPS) where the dynamical physical process is measured by a wireless sensor and the measurements are transmitted to a remote state estimator. It has been shown that the estimation performance strongly depends on the wireless communication quality. To enhance the estimation performance, we apply the cognitive radio technique to the system and propose a CHAnnel seNsing and switChing mEchanism (CHANCE) to explore opportunistic accessibility of multiple channels. We consider two types of wireless channels, i.e., one unlicensed channel which can be accessed freely and several licensed channels which have been pre-assigned to primary users. For the single-licensed-channel case, we develop a necessary condition for the estimation stability based on the physical process dynamics, channel quality and the channel sensing accuracy. This condition becomes also sufficient under certain conditions. We also derive the conditions under which the estimation performance is guaranteed to be improved by CHANCE. The above results are then extended to multi-licensed-channel cases. Simulations based on a particular linear system show that, the long-run mean estimation error covariance with CHANCE is at least 63% less than that without CHANCE. It is also shown that CHANCE outperforms the existing RANDOM mechanism in terms of estimation performance.},

In this paper, we propose a novel EMS formulation for DR problems in these sectors. Specifically, we formulate a fully automated EMS's rescheduling problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and argue that this RL problem can be approximately solved by decomposing it over device clusters. Compared with existing formulations, our new formulation does not require explicitly modeling the user's dissatisfaction on job rescheduling, enables the EMS to self-initiate jobs, allows the user to initiate more flexible requests, and has a computational complexity linear in the number of device clusters. We also demonstrate the simulation results of applying Q-learning, one of the most popular and classical RL algorithms, to a representative example.},

	Abstract = {The power grid is a critical infrastructure that must be protected against potential threats. While modern technologies at the center of the ongoing smart grid evolution increase its operational efficiency, they also make it more susceptible to malicious attacks such as false data injection to electronic monitoring systems. This paper presents a game-theoretic approach to smart grid security by combining quantitative risk management techniques with decision making on protective measures. The consequences of data injection attacks are quantified using a risk assessment process where the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure provides an estimate of the defender's loss due to load shed in simulated scenarios. The calculated risks are then incorporated into a stochastic security game model as input parameters. The decisions on defensive measures are obtained by solving the game using dynamic programming techniques which take into account resource constraints. Thus, the formulated security game provides an analytical framework for choosing the best response strategies against attackers and minimizing potential risks. The theoretical results obtained are demonstrated through numerical examples. Simulation results show that different risk measures lead to different defense strategies, but the CVaR measure prioritizes high-loss tail events.},

Sensors are widely used to collect, store, and analyze on the continuous stream of data of the observation of their day-to-day activities. The output of any sensor may gradually change with time. It may come to a point where it becomes difficult to make a distinction between different situations from the sensor's output. Due to the change of sensor's output with time, it is hard for the system to discriminate very accurately between the regular states and the irregular states. This paper deals with the problems faced with the output of flexiforce sensors that happens when the sensor is in operation for a long period to monitor the activities of the inhabitant. A real-time dynamic thresholding has been designed and introduced to identify different situations clearly and avoid confusions regarding the output of the sensor used.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a knowledge-driven approach to real-time, continuous activity recognition based on multisensor data streams in smart homes. The approach goes beyond the traditional data-centric methods for activity recognition in three ways. First, it makes extensive use of domain knowledge in the life cycle of activity recognition. Second, it uses ontologies for explicit context and activity modeling and representation. Third and finally, it exploits semantic reasoning and classification for activity inferencing, thus enabling both coarse-grained and fine-grained activity recognition. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of smart homes and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) upon which we built both context and ADL ontologies. We present a generic system architecture for the proposed knowledge-driven approach and describe the underlying ontology-based recognition process. Special emphasis is placed on semantic subsumption reasoning algorithms for activity recognition. The proposed approach has been implemented in a function-rich software system, which was deployed in a smart home research laboratory. We evaluated the proposed approach and the developed system through extensive experiments involving a number of various ADL use scenarios. An average activity recognition rate of 94.44 percent was achieved and the average recognition runtime per recognition operation was measured as 2.5 seconds.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we have reported an effective implementation for Internet of Things used for monitoring regular domestic conditions by means of low cost ubiquitous sensing system. The description about the integrated network architecture and the interconnecting mechanisms for the reliable measurement of parameters by smart sensors and transmission of data via internet is being presented. The longitudinal learning system was able to provide a self-control mechanism for better operation of the devices in monitoring stage. The framework of the monitoring system is based on a combination of pervasive distributed sensing units, information system for data aggregation, and reasoning and context awareness. Results are encouraging as the reliability of sensing information transmission through the proposed integrated network architecture is 97%. The prototype was tested to generate real-time graphical information rather than a test bed scenario.},

	Abstract = {The recent worldwide measures for energy savings call for a larger awareness of the household energy consumption, given the relevant contribution of domestic load to the national energy balance. On the other hand, electricity smart meters together with gas, heat, and water meters can be interconnected in a large network offering a potential value to implement energy savings and other energy-related services, as long as an efficient interface with the final user is implemented. Unfortunately, so far, the interface of such devices is mostly designed and addressed at the utilities supervising the system, giving them relevant advantages, while the communication with the household is often underestimated. This paper addresses this topic by proposing the definition of a local interface for smart meters, by looking at the actual European Union and international regulations, at the technological solutions available on the market, and at those implemented in different countries, and, finally, by proposing specific architectures for a proper consumer-oriented implementation of a smart meter network.},

	Abstract = {In modern hospitals, patients are treated using a wide array of medical devices that are increasingly interacting with each other over the network, thus offering a perfect example of a cyber-physical system. We study the safety of a medical device system for the physiologic closed-loop control of drug infusion. The main contribution of the paper is the verification approach for the safety properties of closed-loop medical device systems. We demonstrate, using a case study, that the approach can be applied to a system of clinical importance. Our method combines simulation-based analysis of a detailed model of the system that contains continuous patient dynamics with model checking of a more abstract timed automata model. We show that the relationship between the two models preserves the crucial aspect of the timing behavior that ensures the conservativeness of the safety analysis. We also describe system design that can provide open-loop safety under network failure.},

The experts who develop these complex systems are retiring much faster than universities are graduating engineering majors. As a result, it is important for undergraduates to gain exposure to these kinds of complex systems. This paper describes UPBOT, a robotics testbed hosted at the University of Portland, Portland, OR. The testbed features an extensible robot built from an iRobot Create chassis and a computationally powerful embedded system equipped with a wireless card. In the Spring 2012 semester, the testbed was used for a course project designed and assessed in the style of contract learning. Overall, students were enthusiastic about the hands-on and self-paced nature of the course, but some were concerned by the level of freedom. The lessons learned may inform other educators in project design in robotics education.},

One of the most challenging aspects for many applications in AmI environments is location and orientation of the surrounding objects. This is especially important for effective cooperation among mobile physical objects in such smart environments. In this paper, we propose a robust indoor positioning system that provides 2-D positioning and orientation information for mobile objects. The system utilizes low-range passive radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The proposed system, which consists of RFID carpets and several peripherals for sensor data interpretation, is implemented and tested through extensive experiments.

	Abstract = {This paper presents a nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NILM) strategy for energy management systems in smart buildings. Compared to purely data-driven methods, this paper introduces a prior-knowledge-based model-driven framework. The prior-knowledge includes front-end power supply circuit identification, electrical operating principle, and customer usage. The focus of this paper is on a comprehensive study on front-end power supply circuit topologies and on the commercial power supply market. The former forms the basis of the proposed hierarchical taxonomy from the power electronics' point of view, and the latter study guarantees that the proposed taxonomy represents the majority of appliance loads in the real world. Under the proposed taxonomy, the advantage of the model-driven hierarchical feature extraction is discussed, and initial analysis shows that optimized features can be obtained from this method, which drives a much simpler AND more feasible solution in differentiating the subtle differences between similar loads.},

	Abstract = {It is generally accepted that if dynamic electricity pricing tariffs were to be introduced, their effectiveness in controlling domestic loads will be curtailed if consumers were relied on to respond in their own interests. The complexities of relating behavior to load to price are so burdensome that at least some degree of automation would be required to take advantage of pricing signals. However, a major issue with home automation is fitting in with the lifestyles of individual consumers. Truly smart appliances that can learn the details of their routine operation may be several years away from widespread adoption making integrated home energy management systems unfeasible. Similarly, usage patterns of these same appliances may be substantially different from household to household. The contribution of this paper is the proposal and demonstration of a set of probabilistic models that act in a framework to reduce appliance usage data into contextual knowledge that accounts for variability in patterns in usage. Using sub-metered load data from various domestic wet appliances, the proposed technique is demonstrated learning the appliance operating likelihood surfaces from no prior knowledge.},

	Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) couple their cyber and physical parts to provide mission-critical services, including automated pervasive health care, smart electricity grid, green cloud computing, and surveillance with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). CPSs can use the information available from the physical environment to provide such ubiquitous, energy-efficient and low-cost functionalities. Their operation needs to ensure three key properties, collectively referred to as S3: 1) safety: avoidance of hazards; 2) security: assurance of integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of information; and 3) sustainability: maintenance of long-term operation of CPSs using green sources of energy. Ensuring S3 properties in a CPS is a challenging task given the spatio-temporal dynamics of the underlying physical environment. In this paper, the formal underpinnings of recent CPS S3 solutions are aligned together in a theoretical framework for cyber-physical interactions, empowering CPS researchers to systematically design solutions for ensuring safety, security, or sustainability. The general applicability of this framework is demonstrated with various exemplar solutions for S3 in diverse CPS domains. Further, insights are provided on some of the open research problems for ensuring S3 in CPSs.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of electricity cost management for Internet service providers with a collection of spatially distributed data centers. As the demand on Internet services and cloud computing has kept increasing in recent years, the power usage associated with IDC operations has been uprising significantly. The cyber and physical aspects of IDCs interact with each other, and bring unprecedented challenges in power management. While most existing research focuses on reducing power consumptions of IDCs at one specific location, the problem of reducing the total electricity cost has been overlooked. This is an important problem faced by service providers, especially in the present multielectricity-market environment, where the price of electricity may exhibit temporal and spatial diversities. Further, for these service providers, guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS; i.e., service level objectives) such as service delay guarantees to the end users is of critical importance. This paper studies the problem of minimizing the total electricity cost geared to QoS constraint as well as the location diversity and time diversity of electricity price under multiregional electricity markets. We jointly consider both the cyber and physical management capabilities of IDCs, and exploit both the center-level load balancing and the server-level power control in a unified scheme. We model the problem as a constrained mixed integer programming based on generalized benders decomposition (GBD) technique. Extensive evaluations based on real-life electricity price data for multiple IDC locations demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.},

Of particular interest is the ability to recognize activities in real time from streaming data, but this presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional offline approaches. Among these challenges is handling the large amount of data that does not belong to a predefined class. In this paper, we describe a method by which activity discovery can be used to identify behavioral patterns in observational data. Discovering patterns in the data that does not belong to a predefined class aids in understanding this data and segmenting it into learnable classes. We demonstrate that activity discovery not only sheds light on behavioral patterns, but it can also boost the performance of recognition algorithms. We introduce this partnership between activity discovery and online activity recognition in the context of the CASAS smart home project and validate our approach using CASAS data sets.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel mobile sink area allocation scheme for consumer based mobile robotic devices with a proven application to robotic vacuum cleaners. In the home or office environment, rooms are physically separated by walls and an automated robotic cleaner cannot make a decision about which room to move to and perform the cleaning task. Likewise, state of the art cleaning robots do not move to other rooms without direct human interference. In a smart home monitoring system, sensor nodes may be deployed to monitor each separate room. In this work, a quad tree based data gathering scheme is proposed whereby the mobile sink physically moves through every room and logically links all separated sub-networks together. The proposed scheme sequentially collects data from the monitoring environment and transmits the information back to a base station. According to the sensor nodes information, the base station can command a cleaning robot to move to a specific location in the home environment. The quad tree based data gathering scheme minimizes the data gathering tour length and time through the efficient allocation of data gathering areas. A calculated shortest path data gathering tour can efficiently be allocated to the robotic cleaner to complete the cleaning task within a minimum time period. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively allocate and control the cleaning area to the robot vacuum cleaner without any direct interference from the consumer. The performance of the proposed scheme is then validated with a set of practical sequential data gathering tours in a typical office/home environment.},

	Abstract = {In cyber physical systems, communication is needed for conveying sensor observations to controllers; thus, the design of the communication sub-system is of key importance for the stabilization of system dynamics. In this paper, multicast routing is studied for networking of decentralized sensors and controllers. The challenges of uncertain destinations and multiple routing modes, which are significantly different from traditional data networks, are addressed by employing the theories of hybrid systems and linear matrix inequalities, thus forming a novel framework for studying the communication sub-system in cyber physical systems. Both cases of neglible delay and non-negligible delay are discussed. The proposed framework is then applied in the context of voltage control in smart grid. Numerical simulations using a 4-bus power grid model show that the proposed framework and algorithm can effectively stabilize cyber physical systems.},

We conducted two case studies to derive an ontological model to personalize the planning and execution of interventions to address problematic behaviors. The paper describes how the ontology was derived, and illustrates how it is used to tailor an ambient-assisted intervention system (AAIS) at two stages: first, to decide on the services that the AAIS will offer the PwD, and then to adapt these services at runtime using contextual information. The results of a deployment of an AAIS during 2 months in the home of a PwD, indicate that the AAIS successfully addressed some of the problematic behaviors exhibited by the PwD, helping to reduce the burden of the caregiver.},

Two contributions are presented. On one hand, using sequence mining methods in the flow of sensor events, the most frequent patterns mirroring activities of the inhabitant are discovered; these activities are then modeled by an extended finite automaton, which can then be used for activity recognition and generate activity events. On the other hand, given the set of activities that can be recognized, another automaton is built to model requirements from the medical staff supervising the inhabitant; it accepts activity events, and residuals are defined to detect any behavior deviation. The whole method is applied to the dataset of Domus, an instrumented smart home.},

	Abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) will play a key role in the extension of the smart grid towards residential premises, and enable various demand and energy management applications. Efficient demand-supply balance and reducing electricity expenses and carbon emissions will be the immediate benefits of these applications. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of an in-home energy management (iHEM) application. The performance of iHEM is compared with an optimization-based residential energy management (OREM) scheme whose objective is to minimize the energy expenses of the consumers. We show that iHEM decreases energy expenses, reduces the contribution of the consumers to the peak load, reduces the carbon emissions of the household, and its savings are close to OREM. On the other hand, iHEM application is more flexible as it allows communication between the controller and the consumer utilizing the wireless sensor home area network (WSHAN). We evaluate the performance of iHEM under the presence of local energy generation capability, prioritized appliances, and for real-time pricing. We show that iHEM reduces the expenses of the consumers for each case. Furthermore, we show that packet delivery ratio, delay, and jitter of the WSHAN improve as the packet size of the monitoring applications, that also utilize the WSHAN, decreases.},

	Abstract = {The vision of a smart grid is predicated upon pervasive use of modern digital communication techniques to today's power system. As wide area measurements and control techniques are being developed and deployed for a more resilient power system, the role of communication network is becoming prominent. Power system dynamics gets influenced by the communication delays in the network. Therefore, extensive integration of power system and communication infrastructure mandates that the two systems be studied as a single distributed cyber-physical system. This paper proposes a power system and communication network co-simulation framework (GECO) using a global event-driven mechanism. The accuracy is tunable based on the time-scale requirements of the phenomena being studied. This co-simulation can improve the practical investigation of smart grid and evaluate wide area measurement and control schemes. As a case study, a communication-based backup distance relay protection scheme is co-simulated and validated on this co-simulation framework.},

As a result, the resource management of the OSGi platform has become a critical issue. This paper focuses on how to enhance the efficiency of resource utilization in terms of the service activation and deactivation. We propose the service activator (SA), which is designed as an OSGi bundle, to on-demand activate and deactivate OSGi services, so that the resources required by services can be allocated and deallocated automatically. This involves a graph-based representation of services dependencies and two new algorithms. We have implemented the SA on an OSGi implementation (Knopflerfish); a home network prototype with a home surveillance scenario is presented to demonstrate the feasibility. Furthermore, a simulator is developed to further evaluate the SA in terms of several scenarios; the results show that the SA performs well for a wide range of bundles, and the processing overhead is low.},

Attack techniques proposed in the literature often require detailed knowledge of system parameters. Such information is difficult to acquire in practice. The subspace methods presented in this paper, on the other hand, learn the system operating subspace from measurements and launch attacks accordingly. Conditions for the existence of an unobservable subspace attack are obtained under the full and partial measurement models. Using the estimated system subspace, two attack strategies are presented. The first strategy aims to affect the system state directly by hiding the attack vector in the system subspace. The second strategy misleads the bad data detection mechanism so that data not under attack are removed. Performance of these attacks are evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus network and the IEEE 118-bus network.},

	Abstract = {Within the past decade, mobile computing has morphed into a principal form of human communication, business, and social interaction. Unfortunately, the energy demands of newer ambient intelligence and collaborative technologies on mobile devices have greatly overwhelmed modern energy storage abilities. This paper proposes several novel techniques that exploit spatiotemporal and device context to predict device wireless data and location interface configurations that can optimize energy consumption in mobile devices. These techniques, which include variants of linear discriminant analysis, linear logistic regression, non-linear logistic regression with neural networks, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machines are explored and compared on synthetic and user traces from real-world usage studies. The experimental results show that up to 90% successful prediction is possible with neural networks and k-nearest neighbor algorithms, improving upon prediction strategies in prior work by approximately 50%. Further, an average improvement of 24% energy savings is achieved compared to state-of-the-art prior work on energy-efficient location-sensing.},

	Abstract = {This study presents a smart homecare surveillance system, which utilizes sound-steered cameras to identify behavior of interest. First of all, to detect multiple source locations, a new direction-of-arrival (DOA) algorithm is proposed by introducing cascaded frequency filters, which can quickly calculate directions without creating much complexity. This method can also locate and separate different signals at the same time. Second, after the camera points in the direction of the estimated angle, the proposed state-transition support vector machine is used to provide favorable discriminability for human behavior identification. A new Markov random field (MRF) function based on the localized contour sequence (LCS) is also presented while the system computes transition probabilities between states. Such LCS-based MRF functions can effectively smooth transitions and enhance recognition. The experimental results show that the average error of DOA decreases to around 7$\,^{\circ}$, which is better than those of the baselines. Also, our proposed behavior identification system can reach an 88.3% accuracy rate. The aforementioned results have therefore demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method.},

	Abstract = {The Bluetooth/sup TM/ wireless technology is a cable replacement technology that exploits the wireless interconnectivity that is possible with radio. Bluetooth chips are already available and early applications include cordless connections from mobile phones to laptop computers and wireless headsets. Even if only 10% of mobile phones and computers were to incorporate Bluetooth chips, then the technology would achieve the critical mass necessary for chip prices to fall below $5 and for the standard to become firmly established in the market-place. It is expected that Bluetooth products will be present in the home, where applications will include: conversion of the humble cellphone to a short-range cordless handset; providing a link from a PC to the Internet; home automation and cable replacement; toys and white goods. This paper introduces the Bluetooth wireless technology and its applications and provides a concise description of its air interface and protocol stack.},

	Abstract = {A clear association has been demonstrated between gait stability and falls in the elderly. Integration of wearable computing and human dynamic stability measures into home automation systems may help differentiate fall-prone individuals in a residential environment. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the capability of a pair of electronic textile (e-textile) pants system to assess local dynamic stability and to differentiate motion-impaired elderly from their healthy counterparts. A pair of e-textile pants comprised of numerous e-TAGs at locations corresponding to lower extremity joints was developed to collect acceleration, angular velocity and piezoelectric data. Four motion-impaired elderly together with nine healthy individuals (both young and old) participated in treadmill walking with a motion capture system simultaneously collecting kinematic data. Local dynamic stability, characterized by maximum Lyapunov exponent, was computed based on vertical acceleration and angular velocity at lower extremity joints for the measurements from both e-textile and motion capture systems. Results indicated that the motion-impaired elderly had significantly higher maximum Lyapunov exponents (computed from vertical acceleration data) than healthy individuals at the right ankle and hip joints. In addition, maximum Lyapunov exponents assessed by the motion capture system were found to be significantly higher than those assessed by the e-textile system. Despite the difference between these measurement techniques, attaching accelerometers at the ankle and hip joints was shown to be an effective sensor configuration. It was concluded that the e-textile pants system, via dynamic stability assessment, has the potential to identify motion-impaired elderly.},

	Abstract = {As energy consumption in residential areas is rising, residential homes have deployed a photovoltaic (PV) system to save energy cost. The PV system needs to be continuously monitored to maintain its appropriate performance. In addition, it is desirable to monitor each PV module because one abnormal PV module affects the whole PV system. In this paper, the power line communication (PLC) compliant with HomePlug is adopted to monitor each PV module. The system architecture is composed of three components: PLC modem, renewable energy gateway (REG), and smart device application. The PLC modems are deployed on each PV module and monitor it. The REG aggregates and stores the monitored data from the PLC modems and the inverter. The smart device application retrieves the stored data from the REG to inform users of the status of the PV system. Users can browse and figure out the PV system performance in detail. The proposed system is installed in the field that is composed of sixteen 210W PV modules and a 3kW inverter. This scheme will maintain the performance of a PV system and contribute to enhancing home energy management system.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, the home network has focused on service diversity and the intelligent enhancement of devices for providing user-centric services. Recent studies dealing with home network systems aggregate the sensor data and manage various devices for reasoning the adaptive services. However, home network systems, especially intelligent devices, are difficult to implement due to the high setup cost and the problems with interconnection among other devices in a home domain. Therefore, we consider the intelligent implementation of light switch present in whole spaces. We propose a LED Smart switch with light-weight middleware which provides location-aware service and pattern-based service prediction. The proposed switch with an embedded sensor manages active and passive events according to the sensor data analysis and the service reasoning. Furthermore, the LED smart switch locates the user and interconnects among other switches over a network connection. The smart switch using a LED display provides simple information service, such as weather forecast, stock information, and the light status, using icons and digitalized voices. To evaluate the efficiency of our switch, we implemented testbed, in a home and an office. Our switch reduces the service response time by up to 12% for our experiment.},

This paper explores this technique as applied to acoustic surveillance of abnormal situations. The ultimate goal of the system is to help an authorized person towards taking the appropriate actions for preventing life/property loss. A wide variety of acoustic parameters is employed towards forming a multidomain feature vector, which captures diverse characteristics of the audio signals. Subsequently the feature coefficients are fed to three probabilistic novelty detection methodologies. Their performance is computed using two measures which take into account misdetections and false alarms. Out dataset was recorded under real-world conditions including three different locations where various types of normal and abnormal sound events were captured. A smart-home environment, an open public space, and an office corridor were used. The results indicate that probabilistic novelty detection can provide an accurate analysis of the audio scene to identify abnormal events.},

	Abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered to be a promising solution for current gas shortage and emission problems. To maximize the benefits of using EVs, regulated and optimized charging control needs to be provided by load aggregators for connected vehicles. An EV charging network is a typical cyber-physical system, which includes a power grid and a large number of EVs and aggregators that collect information and control the charging procedure. In this paper, we studied EV charging scheduling problems from a customer's perspective by jointly considering the aggregator's revenue and customers' demands and costs. We considered two charging scenarios: static and dynamic. In the static charging scenario, customers' charging demands are provided to the aggregator in advance; however, in the dynamic charging scenario, an EV may come and leave at any time, which is not known to the aggregator in advance. We present linear programming (LP)-based optimal schemes for the static problems and effective heuristic algorithms for the dynamic problems. The dynamic scenario is more realistic; however, the solutions to the static problems can be used to show potential revenue gains and cost savings that can be brought by regulated charging and, thus, can serve as a benchmark for performance evaluation. It has been shown by extensive simulation results based on real electricity price and load data that significant revenue gains and cost savings can be achieved by optimal charging scheduling compared with an unregulated baseline approach, and moreover, the proposed dynamic charging scheduling schemes provide close-to-optimal solutions.},

	Abstract = {Reliable real-time sensing plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability and safety of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs) such as wireless sensor and actuator networks. For many reasons, such as harsh industrial environments, fault-prone sensors, or malicious attacks, sensor readings may be abnormal or faulty. This could lead to serious system performance degradation or even catastrophic failure. Current anomaly detection approaches are either centralized and complicated or restricted due to strict assumptions, which are not suitable for practical large-scale networked industrial sensing systems (NISSs), where sensing devices are connected via digital communications, such as wireless sensor networks or smart grid systems. In this paper, we introduce a fully distributed general anomaly detection (GAD) scheme, which uses graph theory and exploits spatiotemporal correlations of physical processes to carry out real-time anomaly detection for general large-scale NISSs. We formally prove the scalability of our GAD approach and evaluate the performance of GAD for two industrial applications: building structure monitoring and smart grids. Extensive trace-driven simulations validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency.},

	Abstract = {Wireless Heterogeneous Sensor Network (WHSN) facilitates ubiquitous information acquisition for Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems. It is of great importance of power management and topology control for WHSN to achieve desirable network performances, such as clustering properties, connectivity and power efficiency. This paper proposes a game theoretic model of topology control to analyze the decentralized interactions among heterogeneous sensors. We study the utility function for nodes to achieve desirable frame success rate and node degree, while minimizing the power consumption. Specifically, we propose a static complete-information game formulation for power scheduling and then prove the existence of the Nash equilibrium with simultaneous move. Because the heterogeneous sensors typically react to neighboring environment based on local information and the states of sensors are evolving over time, the power-scheduling problem in WHSN is further formulated into a more realistic incomplete-information dynamic game model with sequential move. We then analyze the separating equilibrium, one of the perfect Bayesian equilibriums resulted from the dynamic game, with the sensors revealing their operational states from their actions. The sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of separating equilibrium are derived for the dynamic Bayesian game, which provide theoretical basis to the proposed power scheduling algorithms, NEPow and BEPow. The primary contributions of this paper include applying game theory to analyze the distributed decision-making process of individual sensor nodes and to analyze the desirable utilities of heterogeneous sensor nodes. Simulations are presented to validate the proposed algorithms and the results show their ability of maintaining reliable connectivity, reducing power consumption, while achieving desirable network performances.},

	Abstract = {Many countries around the world face three major issues associated with their aging societies: a declining population, an increasing proportion of seniors, and an increasing number of single-person households. To explore assistive technologies that can help solve the problems faced by aging societies, we have tested several information and robot technologies. This paper introduces research on a home-assistant robot, which improves the ease and productivity of home activities. For people who work hard outside the home, the assistant robot performs chores in their home environment while they are away. A case study of a life-sized robot with a humanlike functional body performing daily chores is presented. An integrated software system incorporating modeling, recognition, and manipulation skills, as well as a motion generation approach based on the software system, is explained. Moreover, because housekeepers perform chores one after another in their daily environment, we also aim to develop a system for continuously performing a series of tasks by including failure detection and recovery.},

	Abstract = {The proliferation of advanced technologies has been altering our lifestyle and social interactions-the next frontier is the digital home. Although the future of smart homes is promising, many technical challenges must be addressed to achieve convenience and security. In this paper, we delineate the unique combination of security challenges specifically for access control and consider the challenges of how to simply and securely assign access control policies to visitors for home devices and resources. We present a set of intuitive access control policies and suggest four access control settings based on our in-person interview results. Furthermore, we propose the automated Clairvoyant access right assignment (CARA) mechanism that utilizes home owners' social relationship to automatically deduce to which class a visitor belongs. The combination of CARA and the suggested mapping provides a promising first step for home policy assignment such that non-expert home owners can let visitors use their home network with confidence. We anticipate that future research can build on our proposed mechanisms to provide confidence to non-expert home owners for letting visitors use their home network.},

	Abstract = {Intelligent buildings and microgrids are important parts of the future smart grid. The adoption and development process of the intelligent buildings has been slow. There are multiple technical and non-technical reasons. However, two recent trends have accelerated the research and application of the technologies related to this area. First, skyrocketing energy price and the global need for reducing fossil oil consumption for environmental sustainability combined with the fact that buildings are a significant source of energy consumption, making buildings intelligent and energy efficient will have huge impacts on the total CO2 emission and hence global sustainability. Second, rapid popularity and maturation of mobile smart phone technology and Internet technologies like cloud computing enable smart phone holders to be aware of their energy consumption and participate in controlling and running their buildings with seamless Internet connections. Cloud computing enables active interactions between the consumer-side (buildings) and the provider-side (smart grids). Hence, combining energy efficiency and networking perspectives, in this paper, we investigate the key research topics through a broad survey on the latest developments in intelligent buildings and our vision of microgrids formed by such buildings. Our aim is to draw an overall picture of the current research and potential future applications. Moreover, we further summarize and discuss in detail a series of key issues and trends that can potentially motivate and impact the adoption and development of the intelligent building and microgrid technologies in the near future.},

	Abstract = {A brain computer interface-based smart living environmental auto-adjustment control system (BSLEACS) is proposed in this paper. Recently, many environmental control systems have been proposed to improve human quality of life. However, little research has focused on environmental control directly using the human physiological state. Based on the advantage of our technique on brain computer interface (BCI), we integrated the BCI technique with universal plug and play (UPnP) home networking for smart house applications. BSLEACS mainly consists of a wireless physiological signal acquisition module, an embedded signal processing module, a simple control protocol/power line communication environmental controller, and a host system. Here, the physiological signal acquisition module and embedded signal processing module were designed for long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and backend analysis, respectively. The advantages of low power consumption and small volume of the above modules are suitable for smart house applications in daily life. Moreover, different from other BCI systems, the property of using only a single EEG channel to monitor cognitive state also makes BSLEACS become more practicable. BSLEACS has been verified in a practical demo room, and the environmental adjustment can be automatically controlled by the change of the user's cognitive state. BSLEACS provides a novel system prototype for environmental control, and can be simply extended and integrated with the UPnP home networking for other applications.},

Location sensors are placed in each room of the HIS/sup 2/, allowing the monitoring of patient's successive activity phases within the patient's home environment. We proceeded with a sampling in an hourly schedule to detect weak rhythmic variations. Based on numerous measurements, we established a mean value with confidence limits. These also allowed us to define a zone within which the patient's activity is qualified to be "predictable." Alerts are set off if the patient's activity deviates from this zone.},

In a so-called man-in-the-middle attack, an adversary alters data from certain meters and network switches to mislead the control center with an incorrect network topology while avoiding detections by the control center. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an undetectable attack is obtained for strong adversaries who can observe all meter and network data. For weak adversaries with only local information, a heuristic method of undetectable attack is proposed. Countermeasures to prevent undetectable attacks are also considered. It is shown that undetectable attacks do not exist if a set of meters satisfying a certain branch covering property are protected. The proposed attacks are tested with IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus system, and their effect on real-time locational marginal pricing is examined.},

	Abstract = {Digital displays, as the replacement of traditional static signs, have gained increasing popularity for out-of-home advertising. Latest advancements in smartphone, wireless communication, and digital display technologies make it possible to design new interactive signage systems linking the digital content with the physical digital displays. Although recent studies have demonstrated the trend of cyber-physical interaction, they are not generally scalable for multiple users, and none of them support interaction with multiple displays in one location. Smart Signage, a ``draggable'' cyber-physical broadcast/multicast (B/M) media system is proposed in this paper. With a novel cyber-physical B/M protocol that synchronizes the content on the digital displays with the smartphones, it supports one-to-many interaction by allowing multiple users acquiring content from one display with a ``dragging'' hand gesture. With the embedded display orientation information in the same protocol, Smart Signage supports many-to-many interaction by allowing users obtaining content from the digital display they are pointing at with their smartphones. Users' quality of experience, which is characterized by the response time, is carefully studied in this paper to guarantee the performance of this cyber-physical interactive display system.},

	Abstract = {Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems (VCPS) provide human drivers with various services related to road safety, and on-road infotainments. Since a service (message) delivery includes service transmission, service display and driver processing, many challenges arise due to limited network resources, possible pre-emption and contention between services for the display and non-negligible driver processing delay. In this paper, we address a new Driver-centric Service Delivery Problem (DSDP) from a cross-disciplinary resource allocation standpoint. Our goal is to deliver a number of services to a set of intended drivers in a given time period so as to maximize the system-wide performance in terms of total utility income (TUI) to drivers. We show that DSDP differs from all existing problems and is NP-Complete. A number of efficient heuristics are proposed to address several issues, including wireless transmission failure as well as distributed implementation of the multi-sender systems. Utilizing real traces collected from taxis in the city of Shanghai, we also present a case study in a more realistic scenario and conduct comprehensive simulations providing numerical results.},

Studies on various energy resources such as energy storage systems and fuel cells in a smart home environment are required for HEMS development. In the area of the HEMSs, however, there exists very limited research on heating and air conditioning scheduling incorporating customer convenience. This paper presents a smart heating and air conditioning scheduling method for HEMS that considers customer convenience as well as characteristics of thermal appliances in a smart home environment.

	Abstract = {The operation and control of the existing power grid system, which is challenged with rising demands and peak loads, has been considered passive. Congestion is often discovered in high-demand regions, and at locations where abundant renewable energy is generated and injected into the grid; this is attributed to a lack of transmission lines, transfer capability, and transmission capacity. While developing distributed generation (DG) tends to alleviate the traditional congestion problem, employing information and communications technology (ICT) helps manage DG more effectively. ICT involves a vast amount of data to facilitate a broader knowledge of the network status. Data computation and communications are critical elements that can impact the system performance. In this paper, we consider congestion caused by power surpluses produced from households' solar units on rooftops or on ground. Disconnecting some solar units is required to maintain the reliability of the distribution grid. We propose a model for the disconnection process via smart metering communications between smart meters and the utility control center. By modeling the surplus congestion issue as a knapsack problem, we can solve it by proposed greedy solutions. Reduced computation time and data traffic in the network can be achieved.},

	Abstract = {By exploiting the communication infrastructure among the sensors, actuators, and control systems, attackers may compromise the security of smart-grid systems, with techniques such as denial-of-service (DoS) attack, random attack, and data-injection attack. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of the system to study these pitfalls and propose a robust security framework for the smart grid. Our framework adopts the Kalman filter to estimate the variables of a wide range of state processes in the model. The estimates from the Kalman filter and the system readings are then fed into the χ2-detector or the proposed Euclidean detector. The χ2-detector is a proven effective exploratory method used with the Kalman filter for the measurement of the relationship between dependent variables and a series of predictor variables. The χ2-detector can detect system faults/attacks, such as DoS attack, short-term, and long-term random attacks. However, the studies show that the χ2-detector is unable to detect the statistically derived false data-injection attack. To overcome this limitation, we prove that the Euclidean detector can effectively detect such a sophisticated injection attack.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of the microprocessor industry, combined with the reduction on cost and increase of efficiency, gives rise to new scenario for ubiquitous computing where humans trigger seamlessly activities and tasks using unusual (often imperceptible) interfaces according to physical space and context. Many problems must be faced: adaptivity, hybrid control strategies, system (hardware) integration, and ubiquitous networking access. In this paper, a solution that attempts to provide a flexible and dependable solution to these complicated problems is illustrated. First, an extensible markup language (XML)-derived technologies is proposed to define fuzzy markup language (FML), a markup language skilled for defining detailed structure of fuzzy control independent from its legacy representation. FML is essentially composed of three layers: 1) XML in order to create a new markup language for fuzzy logic control; 2) document type definition in order to define the legal building blocks; and 3) extensible stylesheet language transformations in order to convert a fuzzy controller description into a specific programming language. Then an agent-based framework designed for providing proactive services in domotic environments, is presented. The agent architecture, exploiting mobile computation, is able to maximize the fuzzy control deployment for the natively FML representation by performing an efficient distribution of pieces of the global control flow over the different computers. Agents are also used to capture user habits, to identify requests, and to apply the artefact-mediated activity through an adaptive fuzzy control strategy. The architecture adopts interoperability techniques that, combined with sophisticated control facilities, represent an efficient experience for adaptive domotic framework.},

@article{6355649,
	Abstract = {Ambient intelligence is a new information paradigm, where people are empowered through a digital environment that is ``aware'' of their presence and context and is sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to their needs. Hence, one of the important requirements for ambient intelligent environments (AIEs) is the ability to localize the whereabouts of the user in the AIE to address her/his needs. In order to protect user privacy, the use of cameras is not desirable in AIEs, and hence, there is a need to rely on nonintrusive sensors. There are various localization means that are available for outdoor spaces such as those which rely on satellite signals triangulation. However, these outdoor localization means cannot be used in indoor environments. The majority of nonintrusive and noncamera-based indoor localization systems require the installation of extra hardware such as ultrasound emitters/antennas, radio-frequency identification (RFID) antennas, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization system that is based on WiFi signals which are free to receive, and they are available in abundance in the majority of domestic spaces. However, free WiFi signals are noisy and uncertain, and their strengths and availability are continuously changing. Hence, we present a fuzzy logic-based system which employs free available WiFi signals to localize a given user in AIEs. The proposed system receives WiFi signals from a large number of existing WiFi access points (up to 170 access points), where no prior knowledge of the access points locations and the environment is required. The system employs an incremental lifelong learning approach to adjust its behavior to the varying and changing WiFi signals to provide a zero-cost localization system which can provide high accuracy in real-world living spaces. We have compared our system in both simulated and real environments with other relevant techniques in the literature, and we have found that our system outperforms the other systems in the offline learning process, whereas our system was the only system which is capable of performing online learning and adaptation. The proposed system was tested in real-world spaces from a living lab intelligent apartment (iSpace) to a town center apartment to a block of offices. In all these experiments, our system has been highly accurate in detecting the user in the given AIEs, and the system was able to adapt its behavior to changes in the AIE or the WiFi signals. We envisage that the proposed system will play an important role in AIEs, especially for privacy concerned situations like elderly care scenarios.},

The overall function of ITS is to improve decision making, often in real time, by transport network controllers and other users, thereby improving the operation of the entire transport system.

Communication systems play a critical role in interactive grid control as an indispensable medium to transmit wide-area measurements; however, they are vulnerable to disruptions leading to the risk of destabilizing power systems. This work addresses a critical issue related to engineering resilient cyber-physical systems. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical set of wide-area measurements for control and employs channel switching based on mathematical morphology identification to counteract the impact of communication failures on control effectiveness. The proposed control framework incorporating a set of synchronized wide-area measurements is designed to consist of multiple single-input single-output supplementary damping controllers associated with a static VAr compensator.

	Abstract = {Smart grid is a cyber-physical system that integrates power infrastructures with information technologies. To facilitate efficient information exchange, wireless networks have been proposed to be widely used in the smart grid. However, the jamming attack that constantly broadcasts radio interference is a primary security threat to prevent the deployment of wireless networks in the smart grid. Hence, spread spectrum systems, which provide jamming resilience via multiple frequency and code channels, must be adapted to the smart grid for secure wireless communications, while at the same time providing latency guarantee for control messages. An open question is how to minimize message delay for timely smart grid communication under any potential jamming attack. To address this issue, we provide a paradigm shift from the case-by-case methodology, which is widely used in existing works to investigate well-adopted attack models, to the worst-case methodology, which offers delay performance guarantee for smart grid applications under any attack. We first define a generic jamming process that characterizes a wide range of existing attack models. Then, we show that in all strategies under the generic process, the worst-case message delay is a U-shaped function of network traffic load. This indicates that, interestingly, increasing a fair amount of traffic can in fact improve the worst-case delay performance. As a result, we demonstrate a lightweight yet promising system, transmitting adaptive camouflage traffic (TACT), to combat jamming attacks. TACT minimizes the message delay by generating extra traffic called camouflage to balance the network load at the optimum. Experiments show that TACT can decrease the probability that a message is not delivered on time in order of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, an agent based control formulation of a large-scale cyber-physical system is proposed. Each agent can partially observe a part of the global dynamical process and estimate the associated local states through a combination of traditional Kalman filtering algorithm and consensus. The local estimates are then used for state feedback control. The optimal feedback gain of individual agents is obtained through dynamically solving a moving horizon linear quadratic optimization problem. The agents also exchange information among neighbors to coordinate the agent-wise state-feedback controls. Finally, a control decision incurring the least cost among all agents is applied to the global system. A Lyapunov function-based stability analysis is performed to obtain a bound over the degree of agent negotiation in designing the control decision. Besides, the effect of lossy communication network in control design and henceforth in global system stability is also investigated and the corresponding bound in control consensus is obtained. The theoretical results are verified via simulation of a 10-agent and a 50-agent dynamical process within a radial topology.},

	Abstract = {In other to save energy, several countries recently made laws related to standby power consumption. To success this exertion, we should consider not only power reduction of consumer electronics itself but also efficient automatic control in networked home environment. In this paper, we present a design approach and implementation result of control mechanism for standby power reduction. Proposed mechanism has the host-agent based structure and uses the IEEE 802.15.4 based ZigBee protocol for communication and security between host and agents. We verified reliability of proposed mechanism and reduction effect of standby power; also, we applied implemented device to scenario which is similar to user living pattern. Experimental results demonstrate that in the proposed mechanism, standby power consumption of Agent which is connected to consumer electronics can be reduced by 203 mW.},

	Abstract = {We propose a data integration and reasoning technique for automatic environment discovery in smart homes based on observations of user interactions with objects. This approach is complementary to traditional appearance-based object recognition, which often demands large training sets. In our approach, object recognition is achieved in a semantic way by linking object behaviors to the pose and activity of the person using them. The complex relations between objects and user activities are modeled with a Markov logic network. The embodiments of the proposed approach in two multicamera smart environments are described, and the experimental results are presented.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports on the first demonstration of multifrequency (176-, 222-, 307-, and 482-MHz) oscillators based on the piezoelectric AlN contour-mode microelectromechanical systems technology. All the oscillators show phase noise values between -88 and -68 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset frequency from the carriers and phase noise floor values as low as -160 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. The same Pierce circuit design is employed to sustain oscillations at the four different frequencies; on the other hand, the oscillator core consumes 10 mW. The AlN resonators are currently wire bonded to the integrated circuit realized in the AMIS 0.5-¿m 5-V complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor process. Limits on phase noise and power consumption are discussed and compared with other competing technologies. This paper constitutes a substantial step forward toward the demonstration of a single-chip multifrequency reconfigurable timing solution that can be used in wireless communications and sensing applications.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the scalability of three communication architectures for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grid. AMI in smart grid is a typical cyber-physical system (CPS) example, in which large amount of data from hundreds of thousands of smart meters are collected and processed through an AMI communication infrastructure. Scalability is one of the most important issues for the AMI deployment in smart grid. In this study, we introduce a new performance metric, accumulated bandwidthdistance product (ABDP), to represent the total communication resource usages. For each distributed communication architecture, we formulate an optimization problem and obtain the solutions for minimizing the total cost of the system that considers both the ABDP and the deployment cost of the meter data management system (MDMS). The simulation results indicate the significant benefits of the distributed communication architectures over the traditional centralized one. More importantly, we analyze the scalability of the total cost of the communication system (including MDMS) with regard to the traffic load on the smart meters for both the centralized and the distributed communication architectures. Through the closed form expressions obtained in our analysis, we demonstrate that the total cost for the centralized architecture scales linearly as O(λN), with N being the number of smart meters, and λ being the average traffic rate on a smart meter. In contrast, the total cost for the fully distributed communication architecture is O(λ2/3N2/3), which is significantly lower.},

Our laboratory's current research focuses on the monitoring of elderly people at home, to detect a loss of autonomy as early as possible. Our aim is to quantify criteria such as the international activities of daily living (ADL) or the French Autonomie Gerontologie Groupes Iso-Ressources (AGGIR) scales, by automatically classifying the different ADL performed by the subject during the day. A Health Smart Home is used for this. Our Health Smart Home includes, in a real flat, infrared presence sensors (location), door contacts (to control the use of some facilities), temperature and hygrometry sensor in the bathroom, and microphones (sound classification and speech recognition). A wearable kinematic sensor also informs postural transitions (using pattern recognition) and walk periods (frequency analysis). This data collected from the various sensors are then used to classify each temporal frame into one of the ADL that was previously acquired (seven activities: hygiene, toilet use, eating, resting, sleeping, communication, and dressing/undressing). This is done using support vector machines. We performed a 1-h experimentation with 13 young and healthy subjects to determine the models of the different activities, and then we tested the classification algorithm (cross validation) with real data.},

	Abstract = {Traffic volume measurement is critical in vehicular networks. Existing research on traffic volume measurement mainly focuses on single-point traffic statistics. In this paper, we switch our view from single-point to multi-point and study the important problem of privacy-preserving multi-point traffic volume measurement in vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs), which complements the state of the art. While embracing automatic traffic data collection, which the VCPS provides through vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, we also need to accept the accompanying challenges: First, the privacy of all participating vehicles should be preserved as an inherent requirement of a VCPS; second, the measurement scheme should be efficient enough to fit today's large-scale vehicular networks. In this paper, we start from a novel scheme that measures traffic volume between two arbitrary points (locations) through variable-length bit array masking. Then, we extend the idea of variable-length bit array masking to address the more challenging problem of three-point traffic measurement and present a general framework to measure traffic among three or more locations. We also perform extensive simulations to demonstrate the superior performance, applicability, and scalability of our schemes.},

Cost, power consumption, maintainability, and relevant data volume are such view points, and they support better ecological home network. This paper first discusses the technology components which support realization of a home network. They are network technologies, varieties of devices, software-based systems and standards, and home gateway, the key component of a better home network. Then, the author shows several considerations from the ecological viewpoints such as cost saving, energy saving, human load saving, and data volume saving.

	Abstract = {Several applications within a shipboard system involve the integration of physical systems (e.g., power systems) and cyber computing platforms such as command and control, communications, and sensing networks, and require real-time quality of service (QoS) guarantees. In this paper, the distribution of total (end-to-end) delay associated with fault diagnosis and reconfiguration of shipboard power system (SPS) is investigated from a cyber-physical systems (CPS) perspective. Specifically, a cross-layer end-to-end delay analysis framework is introduced for SPS reconfiguration. The proposed framework stochastically models the heterogeneity of actions of various subsystems involved in the reconfiguration tasks viz., generation of fault information by sensor nodes associated to the power system, processing of actions at control center to resolve fault locations and reconfiguration, and flow of information through communication network to perform necessary actions. The proposed framework then combines appropriately the output delay distributions from each subsystem to: 1) analytically predict the distribution of end-to-end delay in SPS reconfiguration after the occurrence of faults and 2) analyze and design real-time reconfiguration solutions for shipboard CPS, that meet total delay requirements. Simulations using various topological scenarios demonstrate that the proposed analytical framework closely predict the total delay associated with SPS reconfiguration.},

	Abstract = {In a nonstrenuous exercise, the heart rate (HR) shows a linear relationship with the maximum volume of oxygen consumption VO2Max and serves as an indicator of performance of the cardiovascular system. The HR replaces the %VO2Max in exercise program prescription to improve aerobic endurance. In order to achieve an optimal effect in an endurance training, the athlete needs to work out at an HR high enough to trigger the aerobic metabolism, while avoiding the very high HRs that bring along significant risks of myocardial infarction. The minimal and optimal base training programs, followed by stretching exercises to prevent injuries, are adequate programs to maximize benefits and minimize health risks for the cardiovascular system during single session training. In this paper, we have defined a functional model for an ambient intelligence system that monitors, evaluates, and trains the aerobic endurance. It is based on the Android operating system and the Gow Running smart shirt. The system has been evaluated during functional assessment stress testing of aerobic endurance in the Stress Physiology Laboratory (SPL) of the Technical University of Madrid. Furthermore, a voice system designed to guide the user through minimal and optimal base training programs has been evaluated. The results obtained fully confirm the model with a high correlation between the data collected by the system and the by SPL. There is also a high hit rate between training sessions of the users and the objective training functions defined in the training programs.},

	Abstract = {Home energy management system (HEMS) is expected as one of the promising technologies to satisfy the demand. We are developing HEMS assisted by a sensor network having an efficient wireless power supply in order to be spreading around the people. Then we have studied the resonant-type wireless power transmission applying for HEMS because the transmitting power is comparatively high in the middle range by using resonant way. In our study, we have derived the formula of transmitting power efficiency in the system of including exciting coil and resonant coil. And the transmitting characteristic using single loop coil is measured. The calculated value with derived equation and measured value are in good agreement. Also we have tried to calculate using electromagnetic numerical method. After showing the validation of both calculation methods, we have examined the way of coil arrangement that transmitting distance is more than 1 m under the condition of human body safety protection guideline from electromagnetic wave. Finally we have arrived at the design of using the pair resonant coils which are very large coil for transmitting and the small coil for receiving.

	Abstract = {Smart and energy-efficient buildings have recently become a trend for future building industry. The major challenge in the control system design for such a building is to minimize the power consumption without compromising the customers comfort. For this purpose, a hierarchical multiagent control system with an intelligent optimizer is proposed in this study. Four types of agents, which are switch agent, central coordinator-agent, local controller-agent, and load agent, cooperate with each other to achieve the overall control goals. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized to optimize the overall system and enhance the intelligence of the integrated building and microgrid system. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) based platform is designed for customers to input their preferences and monitor the results. Two sets of case studies are carried out and corresponding simulation results are presented in this paper.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the design of a smart household environment illumination dimming-control. The control can be operated using either an Android App or a computer using either Wi-Fi or Zigbee to connect to a Database Management System (DBMS). The DBMS can synchronize with a central controller in order to achieve simple and convenient dimming-control of the user's home illumination. In this paper, a linear dimming scheme was adopted to reduce the light gleaming. In order to achieve suitable variations in the illumination environment, a highly-efficient three-color LED was used as the light source. This paper covers the designs of six environment illumination controls for users who can deliver the control states to the central controller and mobile phone. A 24 V DC power supply was designed in this system and can collocate with the DC/DC converter to form a power module suitable for general home use. The interface of the proposed environment illumination control is clear and simple; one can verify that the design presented in this paper possesses very high practicability from the experimental results.},

	Abstract = {While the importance of robustness in engineering design is well accepted, it is less clear how to design cyber-physical systems (CPS) for robustness. With the objective of developing a robustness theory for CPS, we introduce a notion of robustness for cyber systems inspired by existing notions of input-output stability in control theory. We show that the proposed notion of robustness captures two intuitive goals: bounded disturbances lead to bounded deviations from nominal behavior, and the effect of a sporadic disturbance disappears in finitely many steps. For cyber systems modeled as finite-state transducers, the proposed notion of robustness can be verified in pseudo-polynomial time. The synthesis problem, consisting of designing a controller enforcing robustness, can also be solved in pseudo-polynomial time.},

Based on data collected from wearable motion sensors and the associated locational context, this paper presents a coherent anomaly detection framework to effectively detect different behavioral anomalies in human daily life. Four types of anomalies, including spatial anomaly, timing anomaly, duration anomaly, and sequence anomaly, are detected using a probabilistic theoretical framework. This framework is based on complex activity recognition using dynamic Bayesian network modeling. The maximum-likelihood estimation algorithm and Laplace smoothing are used in learning the parameters in the anomaly detection model. We conducted experimental evaluation in a mock apartment environment, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Power-line communication (PLC) presents a 'no new wires' solution for home networks. However, power line is a troublesome and noisy platform for home networks. And the traditional approach with PLC is interference-limited and has a small bandwidth. In this paper we propose a new scheme of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to provide better noise-limited PLC networks. This schema is based on loosely synchronous (LS) codes with very nice correlations. Construction criteria of LS codes used in the proposed system are provided and discussed. The capacity properties and spectral efficiency of LS coded OFDM systems over PLC channels are also studied in this paper. We show that the proposed LS coded OFDM can efficiently achieve the diversity provided by power line channels. Such a schema can be employed in PLC to increase data throughput, system capacity and spectral efficiency in home networks},

Seismic raw data consists of information regarding earthquake's origin time, location, wave velocity, etc. Currently, these high volume data are gathered manually from each station for analysis. This process restricts us from obtaining high-resolution images in real-time. A new in-network distributed method is required that can obtain a high-resolution seismic tomography in real time. In this paper, we present a distributed multigrid solution to reconstruct seismic image over large dense networks. The algorithm performs in-network computation on large seismic samples and avoids expensive data collection and centralized computation. Our evaluation using synthetic data shows that the proposed method accelerates the convergence and reduces the number of messages exchanged. The distributed scheme balances the computation load and is also tolerant to severe packet loss.},

Firewall filtering rules have to be written, ordered, and distributed carefully in order to avoid firewall policy anomalies that might cause network vulnerability. Therefore, inserting or modifying filtering rules in any firewall requires thorough intrafirewall and interfirewall analysis to determine the proper rule placement and ordering in the firewalls. In this paper, we identify all anomalies that could exist in a single- or multifirewall environment. We also present a set of techniques and algorithms to automatically discover policy anomalies in centralized and distributed firewalls. These techniques are implemented in a software tool called the "Firewall Policy Advisor" that simplifies the management of filtering rules and maintains the security of next-generation firewalls.},

	Abstract = {Vulnerability assessment is a requirement of NERC's cybersecurity standards for electric power systems. The purpose is to study the impact of a cyber attack on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Compliance of the requirement to meet the standard has become increasingly challenging as the system becomes more dispersed in wide areas. Interdependencies between computer communication system and the physical infrastructure also become more complex as information technologies are further integrated into devices and networks. This paper proposes a vulnerability assessment framework to systematically evaluate the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems at three levels: system, scenarios, and access points. The proposed method is based on cyber systems embedded with the firewall and password models, the primary mode of protection in the power industry today. The impact of a potential electronic intrusion is evaluated by its potential loss of load in the power system. This capability is enabled by integration of a logic-based simulation method and a module for the power flow computation. The IEEE 30-bus system is used to evaluate the impact of attacks launched from outside or from within the substation networks. Countermeasures are identified for improvement of the cybersecurity.},

	Abstract = {The current smart home is a ubiquitous computing environment consisting of multiple autonomous spaces, and its advantage is that a service interacting with home users can be set with different configurations in space, hardware, software, and quality. As well as being smart technologically speaking, a smart home should also never forget to retain the ``home nature'' when it is serving its users. In this paper, we first analyze the relationship among services, spaces, and users, and then we propose a framework as well as a corresponding algorithm to model their interaction relationship. Later, we also realize the human-system interaction framework to implement a smart home system and develop ``pervasive applications'' to demonstrate how to utilize our framework to fulfill the human-centric interaction requirement of a smart home. Finally, our preliminary evaluations show that our proposed work can enhance the performance of the human-system interaction in a smart home environment.},

	Abstract = {Historically, the unpredictable on-off switching of loads has been a major obstacle to low-voltage power-line communications. Some researchers have gathered valuable data and have proposed statistical models in order to try and mitigate these sudden changes in access impedance. Others have proposed network conditioning in order to ¿block off¿ harsh loads from the power-line network by means of series filters. These filters are expensive, as they have to be rated at the typical current that is drawn by the load to be `blocked off'. Also, in many cases, these are the very loads than need to be monitored and controlled for home automation. This paper investigates the possibility of utilizing a simple, dual coupler to diminish the impact of switching loads on data transmission. First, the design of a suitable dual coupler is demonstrated, using a commercially available high-frequency transformer. Next, laboratory as well as live 220-V measurements are done for 50-¿ modems at frequencies below 1 MHz. These measurements confirm that the proposed dual coupler can help to counter the impact of switching power-line loads by means of (i) improved transmission when a certain network point is loaded and (ii) more predictable (lower) power-line impedance levels-facilitating more accurate overall impedance adaptation.},

	Abstract = {In Smart Spaces (SSs), the capability of learning from experience is fundamental for autonomous adaptation to environmental changes and for proactive interaction with users. New research trends for reaching this goal are based on neurophysiological observations of human brain structure and functioning. A learning technique that is used to provide the SS with the so-called Autobiographical Memory is presented here by drawing inspiration from a bio-inspired model of the interactions occurring between the system and the user. Starting from the hypothesis that user's actions have a direct influence on the internal system state variables and vice versa, a statistical voting algorithm is proposed for inferring the cause/effect relationships among users and the system. The main contribution of this paper lies in proposing a general framework that is able to allow the SS to be aware of its present state as well as of the behavior of its users and to be able to predict the expected consequences of user actions.},

	Abstract = {Smart community leverages information and communications technology to improve the quality of life in terms of education, health care, and government services. In smart community, residents manage their home appliances to cooperate on stabilizing renewable power supply, energy saving, and information communications. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme (EPS) for smart community to enable residents to receive some Internet bandwidth from cooperative nearby homes so as to obtain pervasive Internet access at the cheap cost. Specifically, the EPS enables a resident to send a service request to nearby homes, and the latter responds the request with either uploading data via Internet connection or forwarding data to other homes via WiFi. As the Internet and WiFi bandwidth for homes is limited, the homes assign residents with different priorities and prefer to serve residents with high priorities. The priority is determined by a proximity score between residents and home owners, and the identity information is not disclosed in the calculation process. Moreover, the EPS preserves the location privacy of residents by adopting the multiple pseudonym techniques. Detailed privacy analyses in terms of the identity privacy and the location privacy are provided. In addition, the communication efficiency is validated through extensive simulations.},

Streaming TV content over the highly pervasive wireless networks allows easy access to personalized entertainment. Focusing on wireless home entertainment which is one of the main driving forces of IPTV development, we develop a Markovian framework that investigates several important issues related to network capacity and streaming quality in an IEEE 802.11e enabled wireless home network. The Markovian framework captures not only the IEEE 802.11e MAC protocol performance, but also the statistical characteristics of IPTV media streams. The inclusion of these two key descriptions allows our model to be practically used in wireless home network planning and design. To deal with the complexity in the model, we apply the efficient Matrix Geometric approach to obtain numerical results. We further perform simulations with real IPTV traffic to not only validate our analytical results, but also obtain further insight to the performance.},

It consists of two ICs, a network controller (NC) and a sensor node (SN), and also Wearable Band (W-Band) to connect them. The Continuous Data Transmission (CDT) protocol is proposed for low power and real-time scalability by in-order data transmission using W-Band among several sensors. Based on this protocol, Linked List based network Manager (LLM) and Adaptive Dual Mode Controller (ADMC) in NC, and low swing data transmitter (D-TX) and its own back-end circuits are introduced. The LLM and ADMC can adaptively change the network configuration according to the dynamic network variances in real-time ( <;500 ms), and D-TX can make low energy data transmitter of 0.33 pJ/b with 20 Mbps data rate for W-Band interface. These two low power ICs, which are implemented in 0.18 μm CMOS process and operates with 1.5 V supply, consume 75 μW and 25 μW, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Automated pedestrian detection, counting, and tracking have received significant attention in the computer vision community of late. As such, a variety of techniques have been investigated using both traditional 2-D computer vision techniques and, more recently, 3-D stereo information. However, to date, a quantitative assessment of the performance of stereo-based pedestrian detection has been problematic, mainly due to the lack of standard stereo-based test data and an agreed methodology for carrying out the evaluation. This has forced researchers into making subjective comparisons between competing approaches. In this paper, we propose a framework for the quantitative evaluation of a short-baseline stereo-based pedestrian detection system. We provide freely available synthetic and real-world test data and recommend a set of evaluation metrics. This allows researchers to benchmark systems, not only with respect to other stereo-based approaches, but also with more traditional 2-D approaches. In order to illustrate its usefulness, we demonstrate the application of this framework to evaluate our own recently proposed technique for pedestrian detection and tracking.},

	Abstract = {Today's home and local-area network environments consist of various types of personal equipments, network devices, and corresponding services. Since such prevalent home network environments frequently deal with private and sensitive information, it is crucial to legitimately provide access control for protecting such emerging environments. As a result, the open services gateway initiative (OSGi) attempted to address this critical issue. However, the current OSGi authorization mechanism is not rigorous enough to fulfill security requirements involved in dynamic OSGi environments. In this paper, we provide a systematic way to adopt a role-based access control (RBAC) approach in OSGi environments. We demonstrate how our authorization framework can achieve important RBAC features and enhance existing primitive access control modules in OSGi service environments. Also, we describe a proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed framework to discuss the feasibility of our approach using an open source implementation of OSGi framework known as Knopflerfish.},

	Abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks are believed to be the enabling technology for Ambient Intelligence. They hold the promise of delivering to a smart communication paradigm which enables setting up an intelligent network capable of handling applications that evolve from user requirements. Cognitive agents capable of making proactive decisions based on learning, reasoning and information sharing when interspersed in sensor networks, may help achieve end-to-end goals of the network even in the presence of multiple constraints and optimization objectives. Cognitive radio at the physical layer of such agents may enable the opportunistic use of the heterogeneous wireless environment. However, research efforts have been discrete and cognitive techniques have focused on improving specific aspects of the network or benefiting specific applications. The main contribution of this paper is providing the vision and advantage of a holistic approach to cognition in sensor networks, which can be achieved by incorporating learning and reasoning in the upper layers, and opportunistic spectrum access at the physical layer. Rather than providing an ostensive survey of cognitive architectures applicable to sensor networks, this paper provides the reader with a framework based on knowledge and cognition that can help achieve end-to-end goals of application-specific sensor networks.},

	Abstract = {A probe data service has been defined as a means for vehicular on-board units (OBUs) to transmit the data collected by their in-vehicle sensors in real time via wireless communication links to road-site units (RSUs). Sensor data fusion algorithms are developed in this work to aggregate data collected through this probe data service for computing single-RSU and multi-RSU average per-division speeds and average route travel times, where a division is defined to be a small segment of a road. These algorithms are evaluated using an integrated simulation testbed that consists of a vehicular simulator and a wireless communication link simulator, which are interconnected via a TCP/IP connection. Our key findings are that the probe data service offers an excellent means for computing average per-division speeds and average route travel times when the market penetration level of OBUs is relatively high. Privacy constraints negatively impact the accuracy of route travel time estimates as routes often span roads under the wireless coverage area of many road-side units requiring frequent vehicle identity changes. The impact of wireless communication losses is quite significant, requiring the use of accurate models in any simulation-based studies.},

	Abstract = {A reliable, scalable, and low-delay information collection network is an essential component in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Cluster-based sensor network is a good candidate because of its advantage in increasing scalability, improving energy efficiency, and providing QoS guarantees. However, in such networks, frequent interactions between the intra-cluster communication and the inter-cluster communication are inevitable, which may severely downgrade the communication efficiency and hence the network performance if not handled properly. Proper synchronization among these two types of communications is required. In this paper, we propose two approaches to schedule the communications in clustered wireless sensor networks aiming at delay-sensitive applications. In the first approach, an efficient cycle-based synchronous scheduling is proposed to achieve low average packet delay and high throughput by optimizing the cycle length and transmission order. In the second approach, a novel clustering structure is introduced to eliminate the necessity of communication synchronization so that packets are transmitted with no synchronization delay, yielding very low end-to-end packet delay. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of both the approaches. These two approaches are then integrated as a hybrid scheme that allows smooth switching between them. The hybrid scheme takes advantage of both the approaches and enables cluster-based sensor networks to serve as the fundamental network infrastructure for information collection in CPS.},

	Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are cyber-physical systems that emerged as a key technology to provide real-time health monitoring and ubiquitous healthcare services. WBANs could operate in dense environments such as in a hospital and lead to a high mutual communication interference in many application scenarios. The excessive interferences will significantly degrade the network performance, including depleting the energy of WBAN nodes more quickly and even eventually jeopardize people's lives because of unreliable (caused by the interference) healthcare data collections. Therefore, it is critical to mitigate the interference among WBANs to increase the reliability of the WBAN system while minimizing the system power consumption. Many existing approaches can deal with communication interference mitigation in general wireless networks but are not suitable for WBANs because of ignoring the social nature of WBANs by them. Unlike the previous research, we for the first time propose a power game based approach to mitigate the communication interferences for WBANs based on the people's social interaction information. Our major contributions include: 1) modeling the inter-WBANs interference and determine the distance distribution of the interference through both theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations; 2) developing social interaction detection and prediction algorithms for people carrying WBANs; and 3) developing a power control game based on the social interaction information to maximize the system's utility while minimize the energy consumption of WBANs system. The extensive simulation results show the effectiveness of the power control game for inter-WBAN interference mitigation using social interaction information. Our research opens a new research vista of WBANs using social networks.},

Mobile IPTV service is based on mobile multicasting to support efficient group communication. However, mobile multicasting has two constraints that we consider: a tunnel convergence problem and high handover latency. To reduce the two constraints, we propose a mobile multicasting model that is feasible for PMIPv6 domain. The proposed model removes tunnel convergence and reduces router processing. We then propose a fast handover scheme using a context transfer mechanism suitable for the proposed model. We also show that the proposed scheme outperforms previously proposed schemes in terms of packet delivery cost and handover latency.},

	Abstract = {Metal oxide (MOX) sensors are widely used in several application fields: environmental monitoring, home automation, food control, and so on. Research activities in this topic are oriented toward new materials and nanotechnologies, thus requiring new instruments for the sensor characterization and management. Often, in order to improve selectivity, sensitivity, stability, the sensor is heated according to purposely designed profiles. The repeatability of the measurement conditions strongly depends on the ability to perform a sensor resistance measurement in a synchronous fashion with respect to the imposed thermal profile. This work proposes an electronic equipment for a complete management of a generic MOX sensor. The system is able to estimate the sensor resistance in a range varying from tens of kilohms up to tens of gigohms, while driving the sensor heater with a thermal profile designed by the user. Thanks to the short readout time (10 ms) and to the synchronism between the heater management and the sensor resistance measurement, the system is suitable for monitoring fast transients and thermal dynamics of the sensors. In addition, an estimation of the sensor parasitic capacitance, modeled in parallel with the resistive part and on the order of few picofarads, is provided for diagnostic purposes. Experimental results conducted on both commercial resistors/capacitors emulating the sensor, and on a real SnO2 nanowire-based sensor for carbon monoxide detection have demonstrated the validity of the proposed approach.

	Abstract = {Upper extremity mobility impairment is a common sequel of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), brain injury, strokes, and degenerative diseases such as Guillain-Barre and ALS. Existing assistive technology solutions that provide access as user input devices are intrusive and expensive, and require physical contact that can have deleterious effects such as skin friction injury for paralyzed users who have reduced skin sensitivity. To address this problem, in this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a non-contact proximity gesture recognition system using fabric capacitive sensor arrays. The fabric sensors are lightweight, flexible, and can be easily integrated into items of quotidian use such as clothing, bed sheets, and pillow covers. Our gesture recognition algorithm builds on two known classification techniques, Hidden Markov Model and Dynamic Time Warping to convert raw capacitance values to alphanumeric gestures. Our system is personalized to the user, allowing personalized selection of gesture sets and definition of gesture patterns in accordance with their capabilities. Our system adapts to changes in sensor configuration and orientation with minimal user training and intervention. We have evaluated our system in the context of a gesture-driven home automation system on six subjects that includes an individual who has a C6 Spinal Cord injury. We show that our system can recognize gestures of varying complexity with an average accuracy of 99 percent with minimal training.},

In order to monitor the functional health of smart home residents, we need to design technologies that recognize and track activities that people normally perform as part of their daily routines. Although approaches do exist for recognizing activities, the approaches are applied to activities that have been preselected and for which labeled training data are available. In contrast, we introduce an automated approach to activity tracking that identifies frequent activities that naturally occur in an individual's routine. With this capability, we can then track the occurrence of regular activities to monitor functional health and to detect changes in an individual's patterns and lifestyle.

	Abstract = {Reverberation deteriorates the quality and intelligibility of speech, leading to the poor performance of classification systems. Room reverberation parameters depend on the location of the speaker and the microphone and the room geometry. For mobile robots, the reverberation is constantly changing due to the relative movement of the speaker and the robot. This can affect the spectral properties of the signal and therefore, the classification accuracy. The contribution of this paper is a new network architecture, which uses neural network constant modulus algorithm (NNCMA) based equalizer followed by a multi-layer preceptron (MLP) classifier. NNCMA is an MLP which is trained with a cost function similar to constant modulus algorithm (CMA). With this two-stage structure, the classifier does not have to consider the time-varying nature of the reverberation. The proposed algorithm is applied to speech samples collected by the home service robot WEVER-R2 for speaker classification in a typical home or office environment. We use them for gender classification application. The proposed neural network was found to have 83.73% of classification accuracy for age classification and 88.91% of classification accuracy for gender classification, while the standard MLP had a classification accuracy of 71.43% and 72.29%, respectively.},

Still, most controller systems provide separate control user interfaces for different uses when users inevitably face an increased number of interfaces for control and interaction tasks in such environment. To simplify burdens of user and reduce complexities in control tasks, we propose a universal appliance controller based on mobile device with two selective interaction modes. First mode is a network scanning-based indirect interaction mode which provides fast and reliable connection to the appliances with specific filters in the networked environment. Second mode is a camera-based direct interaction mode which provides an intuitive interface as an input device. These two modes are interchangeable for different tasks and according to user's preference. Moreover, control user interface is personalized with preference described in user profile to reflect the user of the system better. To verify usefulness of our approach, we present a prototype in a smart home test bed. Through an initial user study, we demonstrate usability of our prototype through a set of mobile interaction tasks. Moreover, we note usability issues, limitations of our work and analyze the participants' feedback.},

	Abstract = {In the near future, a smart grid will accommodate customers who are prepared to invest in generation-battery systems and employ energy management systems in order to cut down on their electricity bills. The main objective of this paper is to determine the optimum capacity of a customer's distributed-generation system (such as a wind turbine) and battery within the framework of a smart grid. The proposed approach involves developing an electricity management system based on stochastic variables, such as wind speed, electricity rates, and load. Then, a hybrid stochastic method based on Monte Carlo simulation and particle swarm optimization is proposed to determine the optimum size of the wind generation-battery system. Several sensitivity analyses demonstrate the proper performance of the proposed method in different conditions.},

	Abstract = {Conventional robotic vacuum cleaners (RVCs) with ultrasonic or infrared (IR) sensors present problems in detecting obstacles when they clean the floor in complex situations, for example, under tables or chairs with thin legs. This paper presents a robust obstacle detection (OD) method based on the triangulation principle for RVCs operating in various home environments. The proposed method uses the IR emitter of the RVC to project a horizontal IR beam toward the floor, following which the RVC's wide-angle vision camera captures an image that includes the IR line reflected by the floor or an obstacle. Obstacles are detected by using the image coordinates of the pixels that belong to the IR line in the captured image. Accurate separation of the IR line from the image background is accomplished by defining and minimizing an energy function based on the characteristics of the IR line. The proposed method was tested on the embedded RVC system and was shown capable of achieving OD performance compared with existing methods.},

	Abstract = {With the fast development of the Internet, wireless communications and semiconductor devices, home networking has received significant attention. Consumer products can collect and transmit various types of data in the home environment. Typical consumer sensors are often equipped with tiny, irreplaceable batteries and it therefore of the utmost importance to design energy efficient algorithms to prolong the home network lifetime and reduce devices going to landfill. Sink mobility is an important technique to improve home network performance including energy consumption, lifetime and end-to-end delay. Also, it can largely mitigate the hot spots near the sink node. The selection of optimal moving trajectory for sink node(s) is an NP-hard problem jointly optimizing routing algorithms with the mobile sink moving strategy is a significant and challenging research issue. The influence of multiple static sink nodes on energy consumption under different scale networks is first studied and an Energy-efficient Multi-sink Clustering Algorithm (EMCA) is proposed and tested. Then, the influence of mobile sink velocity, position and number on network performance is studied and a Mobile-sink based Energy-efficient Clustering Algorithm (MECA) is proposed. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed two algorithms which can be deployed in a consumer home network environment1.},

	Abstract = {Multimedia video sharing has been developed rapidly over the past years. P2P multimedia sharing mechanisms for P2P network such as PPLive, PPStream, Joost, have been used popularly. However, if Content Server and Client in home network have to transmit via P2P sharing, P2P network must be adopted, thus it is unable to increase the network transmission speed through this intranet connection. Although there are DLNA, HAVi, and Jini protocols in home network to share multimedia files, it cannot access P2P network due to the limitation of home network framework. Therefore, this paper proposes a DLNA-based Multimedia Sharing System for OSGI framework with Extension to P2P Network, which extends DLNA multimedia sharing mechanism to P2P network through OSGI platform, so that users can access multimedia resource on P2P Network via DLNA, and P2P network users can apply P2P network mechanism in OSGI bundle to access shared DLNA multimedia resource in home network.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a low-phase-noise, hybrid LC-tank, analog frequency modulator for wireless biotelemetry employing on-chip NMOS varactors in the inversion region as the frequency tuning element. We demonstrate that a correct estimate for the destination signal-to-noise ratio, which quantifies the quality of the wirelessly received signal in a frequency-modulated biotelemetry system, is only achieved after taking into account the large-signal oscillation effect on the tank varactor. A prototype chip is fabricated using AMI 1.5-/spl mu/m double-poly double-metal n-well CMOS process, and exhibits a measured gain factor of 1.21 MHz/V in the mid-range of the tuning voltage and a phase noise of -88.6 dBc/Hz at 10-kHz offset from the 95.1-MHz carrier while dissipating 1.48 mW from a 3 V power supply leading to a figure of merit (FOM) of -166.5 dBc/Hz. The VCO is successfully interfaced with a penetrating silicon microelectrode with 700 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ iridium recording sites for wireless in vitro recording of a 50 Hz simulated normal sinus rhythm signal from saline over a distance of /spl sim/0.25 m. Given a typical gain of /spl sim/40 dB for fully integrated front-end bioamplifiers, a wireless recording microsystem employing this VCO would be capable of detecting input biopotentials down to the submilivolt range.},

Behavior is defined as any pattern in a sequence of observations. In analyzing behavior in a smart home, we aim to detect gradual changes in behavior, and atypical (anomalous) behavior. The anomalous behavior may be the result of equipment failure or the result of significant variations in the behavior of the occupant. In the context of a smart home, both situations require human intervention although the response will differ. For the purpose of observing behavior, the smart home is equipped with embedded sensors that unobtrusively record various environmental parameters.

	Abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become a leading solution in many important applications such as intrusion detection, target tracking, industrial automation, smart building and so on. Typically, a WSN consists of a large number of small, low-cost sensor nodes that are distributed in the target area for collecting data of interest. For a WSN to provide high throughput in an energy-efficient way, designing an efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is of paramount importance because the MAC layer coordinates nodes' access to the shared wireless medium. To show the evolution of WSN MAC protocols, this article surveys the latest progresses in WSN MAC protocol designs over the period 2002-2011. In the early development stages, designers were mostly concerned with energy efficiency because sensor nodes are usually limited in power supply. Recently, new protocols are being developed to provide multi-task support and efficient delivery of bursty traffic. Therefore, research attention has turned back to throughput and delay. This article details the evolution of WSN MAC protocols in four categories: asynchronous, synchronous, frame-slotted, and multichannel. These designs are evaluated in terms of energy efficiency, data delivery performance, and overhead needed to maintain a protocol's mechanisms. With extensive analysis of the protocols many future directions are stated at the end of this survey. The performance of different classes of protocols could be substantially improved in future designs by taking into consideration the recent advances in technologies and application demands.},

	Abstract = {We address covariance estimation in the sense of minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) when the samples are Gaussian distributed. Specifically, we consider shrinkage methods which are suitable for high dimensional problems with a small number of samples (large p small n). First, we improve on the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) method by conditioning on a sufficient statistic. By the Rao-Blackwell theorem, this yields a new estimator called RBLW, whose mean-squared error dominates that of LW for Gaussian variables. Second, to further reduce the estimation error, we propose an iterative approach which approximates the clairvoyant shrinkage estimator. Convergence of this iterative method is established and a closed form expression for the limit is determined, which is referred to as the oracle approximating shrinkage (OAS) estimator. Both RBLW and OAS estimators have simple expressions and are easily implemented. Although the two methods are developed from different perspectives, their structure is identical up to specified constants. The RBLW estimator provably dominates the LW method for Gaussian samples. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the OAS approach can perform even better than RBLW, especially when n is much less than p . We also demonstrate the performance of these techniques in the context of adaptive beamforming.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents data centers from a cyber-physical system (CPS) perspective. Current methods for controlling information technology (IT) and cooling technology (CT) in data centers are classified according to the degree to which they take into account both cyber and physical considerations. To evaluate the potential impact of coordinated CPS strategies at the data center level, we introduce a control-oriented model that represents the data center as two coupled networks: a computational network representing the cyber dynamics and a thermal network representing the physical dynamics. These networks are coupled through the influence of the IT on both networks: servers affect both the quality of service (QoS) delivered by the computational network and the generation of heat in the thermal network. Using this model, three control strategies are evaluated with respect to their energy efficiency and computational performance: a baseline strategy that ignores CPS considerations, an uncoordinated strategy that manages the IT and CT independently, and a coordinated strategy that manages the IT and CT together to achieve optimal performance with respect to both QoS and energy efficiency. Simulation results show that the benefits to be realized from coordinating the control of IT and CT depend on the distribution and heterogeneity of the computational and cooling resources throughout the data center. A new cyber-physical index (CPI) is introduced as a measure of this combined distribution of cyber and physical effects in a given data center. We illustrate how the CPI indicates the potential impact of using coordinated CPS control strategies.},

	Abstract = {Contingency analysis is a critical activity in the context of the power infrastructure because it provides a guide for resiliency and enables the grid to continue operating even in the case of failure. In this paper, we augment this concept by introducing SOCCA, a cyber-physical security evaluation technique to plan not only for accidental contingencies but also for malicious compromises. SOCCA presents a new unified formalism to model the cyber-physical system including interconnections among cyber and physical components. The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity. The results are valuable in both cyber and physical domains. From a physical perspective, SOCCA scores power system contingencies based on cyber network configuration, whereas from a cyber perspective, control network vulnerabilities are ranked according to the underlying power system topology.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we design and implement a home surveillance system based on an embedded system with multiple ultrasonic sensor modules to enhance the system's reliability. Each ultrasonic sensor module includes a transmitter and a receiver, and the modules are placed in a line direction. Because the ultrasonic transmission will spread at a beam angle, we use multiple ultrasonic receivers to receive the ultrasonic transmission. If any intruder passes through the ultrasonic sensing area, the ultrasonic transmission will be blocked by the human body. As the receivers will not receive any transmission from the ultrasonic transmitter, the system will sense when someone is passing through the surveillance area. We use a Majority Voting Mechanism (MVM) for a group of sensors. If over half the sensors in a sensor group sense a signal blocking, the majority voting program starts the Web camera. The mathematical equation and the sensing experiment show that we improve the system's reliabilities.},

The steered response power-phase transform (SRP-PHAT) is a widely used method for robust SSL. However, it is too slow to run in real time, since SRP-PHAT searches a large number of candidate sound source locations. This paper proposes a search space clustering method designed to speed up the SRP-PHAT based sound source localization algorithm for intelligent home robots equipped with small scale microphone arrays. The proposed method reduces the number of candidate sound source locations by 30.6% and achieves 46.7% error reduction compared to conventional methods.},

	Abstract = {This study presents a novel adaptive management strategy for power flow in standalone hybrid power systems. The method introduces an on-line energy management by using a hierarchical controller between three energy sources: photovoltaic (PV) panels, battery storage and proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The proposed method includes a feed-forward, back-propagation neural network controller in the first layer, which is added in order to achieve the maximum power point for the different types of PV panels. In the second layer, a fuzzy logic controller has been developed to optimise performance by distributing the power inside the hybrid system and by managing the charge and discharge of the current flow. Finally, and in the third layer, local controllers are presented to regulate the fuel cell/battery set points in order to reach to best performance. Moreover, perturb and observe algorithm with two different controller techniques - the linear proportional-integral (PI) and the non-linear passivity-based controller - are provided for a comparison with the proposed maximum power point tracking controller system. The comparison revealed the robustness of the proposed PV control system for solar irradiance and load resistance changes. Real-time measured parameters and practical load profiles are used as inputs for the developed management system. The proposed model and its control strategy offer a proper tool for optimising the hybrid power system performance, such as the one used in smart-house applications.},

With this proposal the OSGi potentiality increases because of the huge amount of new services that can be offered as a result of appropriate combinations. To specify the service composition we propose a totally transparent BPEL-style solution which does not break the OSGi standard. However, the syntactic matchmaking provided by the OSGi standard does not enable a flexible enough automatic service composition. Thus, we propose to define a semantic OSGi platform, which combined with the BPEL-style solution fits all the OSGi service composition requirements.},

Thus, early sign detection of a specific condition, as well as, any likely transition from a healthy state to a pathological one are key problems that the herein proposed framework aims at resolving. Statistical process control concepts offer a personalized approach toward identification of trends that are away from the atypical behavior or state of the seniors, while fuzzy cognitive maps knowledge representation and inference schema have proved to be efficient in terms of disease classification. Geriatric depression is used as a case study throughout the paper, so to prove the validity of the framework, which is planned to be pilot tested with a series of lone-living seniors in their own homes.},

	Abstract = {Sit-to-stand (SiSt) analysis has been widely used in clinical practice to assess the risk of falls in the older adult population. This paper proposes automated algorithms for the unobtrusive measurement of SiSt timing and symmetry using bed pressure sensors. An integrated signal comprising all of the sensor outputs was analyzed to measure both the bed-departure timing and the timing of three clinical phases within the transfer. Data collected in clinical trials, along with independent clinical video analysis, verified the success of the bed-departure timing algorithm with a mean error of 0.11 s. The phase measurement algorithm showed significant differences (p <; 0.001) between younger and older adults in Phases II and III of the transfers, comparing well with studies found in recent clinical literature. The sensor outputs were then used to form sequences of pressure images, and an automated region of interest (ROI) detection algorithm was designed to extract regional signals from the hips and the hands. The final algorithm was designed to measure the symmetry of the body throughout the SiSt transfer from the extracted regional signals. A system accuracy of 93.0% was obtained for the automated symmetry classification of transfers. The techniques proposed in this paper can increase the precision and efficiency in clinical SiSt assessments. Their unobtrusive nature makes them particularly suitable for integration into a continuous monitoring system such as those required within the smart home environment.},

A wireless communication infrastructure is assumed for the smart meter network. The dynamics of the power market are assumed to be a Markov decision process (MDP) by modeling the power load evolution as a two-state Markov chain. The fundamental elements of the MDP are discussed and the optimal strategy is obtained from dynamic programming. Due to the curse of dimensions, the myopic strategy is proposed to significantly simplify the algorithm. The validity of the proposed scheduling algorithm is demonstrated using numerical simulations. For example, for price insensitive power users, the average price and power generation errors are reduced by 60% and 40% using the myopic approach, compared with the simple round robin schedule, in certain circumstances.},

	Abstract = {Demand response (DR), which is the action voluntarily taken by a consumer to adjust amount or timing of its energy consumption, has an important role in improving energy efficiency. With DR, we can shift electrical load from peak demand time to other periods based on changes in price signal. At residential level, automated energy management systems (EMS) have been developed to assist users in responding to price changes in dynamic pricing systems. In this paper, a new intelligent EMS (iEMS) in a smart house is presented. It consists of two parts: a fuzzy subsystem and an intelligent lookup table. The fuzzy subsystem is based on its fuzzy rules and inputs that produce the proper output for the intelligent lookup table. The second part, whose core is a new model of an associative neural network, is able to map inputs to desired outputs. The structure of the associative neural network is presented and discussed. The intelligent lookup table takes three types of inputs that come from the fuzzy subsystem, outside sensors, and feedback outputs. Whatever is trained in this lookup table are different scenarios in different conditions. This system is able to find the best energy-efficiency scenario in different situations.},

	Abstract = {Modern approaches to the architecture of living and working environments emphasize the dynamic reconfiguration of space and function to meet the needs, comfort, and preferences of its inhabitants. Although it is possible for a human operator to specify a configuration explicitly, the size, sophistication, and dynamic requirements of modern buildings demands that they have autonomous intelligence that could satisfy the needs of its inhabitants without human intervention. We describe a multiagent framework for such intelligent building control that is deployed in a commercial building equipped with sensors and effectors. Multiple agents control subparts of the environment using fuzzy rules that link sensors and effectors. The agents communicate with one another by asynchronous, interest-based messaging. They implement a novel unsupervised online real-time learning algorithm that constructs a fuzzy rule-base, derived from very sparse data in a nonstationary environment. We have developed methods for evaluating the performance of systems of this kind. Our results demonstrate that the framework and the learning algorithm significantly improve the performance of the building.},

	Abstract = {In cyber-physical systems where sensors measure the temporal evolution of a given phenomenon of interest and radio communication takes place over short distances, the energy spent for source acquisition and compression may be comparable with that used for transmission. Additionally, in order to avoid limited lifetime issues, sensors may be powered via energy harvesting and thus collect all the energy they need from the environment. This work addresses the problem of energy allocation over source acquisition/compression and transmission for energy-harvesting sensors. At first, focusing on a single-sensor, energy management policies are identified that guarantee a minimum average distortion while at the same time ensuring the stability of the queue connecting source and channel encoders. It is shown that the identified class of policies is optimal in the sense that it stabilizes the queue whenever this is feasible by any other technique that satisfies the same average distortion constraint. Moreover, this class of policies performs an independent resource optimization for the source and channel encoders. Suboptimal strategies that do not use the energy buffer (battery) or use it only for adapting either source or channel encoder energy allocation are also studied for performance comparison. The problem of optimizing the desired trade-off between average distortion and backlog size is then formulated and solved via dynamic programming tools. Finally, a system with multiple sensors is considered and time-division scheduling strategies are derived that are able to maintain the stability of all data queues and to meet the average distortion constraints at all sensors whenever it is feasible.},

A mixed-security signal model is firstly proposed to formally describe the properties and requirements on security and real-time for signals, and then a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of SPP security-aware signal packing (SASP) is implemented to solve the tradeoff problem, where the bandwidth utilization is improved and the requirements in both security and real-time are met.

In the proposed method, each FRTU inferring the fault or inrush current determines whether its feeder is a fault or not, and whether its sink zone is a fault zone or not, by exchanging fault information (such as current value, voltage value, current direction) with the other FRTUs on the feeders under the ubiquitous-based distribution system that enables the FRTUs to be connected freely to the network. In order to explain the effectiveness of the proposed method, several cases are simulated for typical distribution using the developed simulator.},

	Abstract = {The vehicular ad hoc network presents a very complex cyber-physical system with intricate interplay between the physical and cyber domains. In the physical domain, vehicles need to frequently broadcast their geographic information. The safety message broadcasting in an area with a high density of vehicles tends to incur a large data traffic rate that should be properly processed in the cyber domain. In this paper, we address the issue of large computation overhead caused by the safety message authentication. Especially, a cooperative message authentication protocol (CMAP) is developed to alleviate vehicles' computation burden. With CMAP, all the vehicles share their verification results with each other in a cooperative way, so that the number of safety messages that each vehicle needs to verify reduces significantly. Furthermore, we study the verifier selection algorithms for a high detection rate of invalid messages in a practical 2-D road scenario. Another important contribution in this paper is that we develop an analytical model for CMAP and the existing probabilistic verification protocol , considering the hidden terminal impact. Simulation results over a practical map are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed CMAP with comparison to the existing method.},

	Abstract = {Graphical models are a framework for representing and exploiting prior conditional independence structures within distributions using graphs. In the Gaussian case, these models are directly related to the sparsity of the inverse covariance (concentration) matrix and allow for improved covariance estimation with lower computational complexity. We consider concentration estimation with the mean-squared error (MSE) as the objective, in a special type of model known as decomposable. This model includes, for example, the well known banded structure and other cases encountered in practice. Our first contribution is the derivation and analysis of the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) in decomposable graphical models. We provide a simple closed form solution to the MVUE and compare it with the classical maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in terms of performance and complexity. Next, we extend the celebrated Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) to graphical models. Using SURE, we prove that the MSE of the MVUE is always smaller or equal to that of the biased MLE, and that the MVUE itself is dominated by other approaches. In addition, we propose the use of SURE as a constructive mechanism for deriving new covariance estimators. Similarly to the classical MLE, all of our proposed estimators have simple closed form solutions but result in a significant reduction in MSE.},

@article{7055837,
	Abstract = {The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interaction and communication between billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real-world objects (i.e. things). Extracting higher level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract, and characterize meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machine-understandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring, and smart home applications, and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data. A considerable amount of methods from machine-learning, the semantic web, as well as pattern and data mining have been used to abstract from sensor observations to information representations. This paper provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current state-of-the-art in this area. This paper also identifies research directions at the edge of information abstraction for sensor data. To ease the understanding of the abstraction workflow process, we introduce a software toolkit that implements the introduced techniques and motivates to apply them on various data sets.},

However, these devices lack native support for many advanced features such as service differentiation, etc., that are required in specific application domains. In this paper, we propose Covenant, a software based cooperative scheduling framework to provide a rich set of features for applications that require nodes to cooperate with each other to satisfy system-wide objectives. We propose a novel 2 1/2-stage pipeline architecture as an efficient mechanism to implement cooperative scheduling among multiple nodes. We demonstrate how Covenant can be easily implemented in software, thus requiring absolutely no hardware or firmware changes to the already widely installed base of 802.11a/b/g based wireless devices. We also evaluate, using a real Linux based test-bed with Covenant drivers, the efficacy of the approach on two different scheduling disciplines: proportional priority and strict priority. We demonstrate that these scheduling disciplines are effective in providing service guarantees to multimedia applications even in the presence of other competing traffic.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers situations in which a team of mobile sensor platforms autonomously explores an environment to detect and localize an unknown number of targets. Individual sensors may be unreliable, failing to detect objects within the field-of-view, returning false positive measurements to clutter objects, and being unable to disambiguate true targets. In this setting, data association is difficult. We utilize the PHD filter for multitarget localization, simultaneously estimating the number of objects and their locations within the environment without the need to explicitly consider data association. Using sets of potential actions generated at multiple length scales for each robot, the team selects the joint action that maximizes the expected information gain over a finite time horizon. This is computed as the mutual information between the set of targets and the binary events of receiving no detections, effectively hedging against uninformative actions in a computationally tractable manner. We frame the controller as a receding-horizon problem. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of the proposed autonomous exploration strategy through hardware experiments, exploring an office environment with a team of ground robots. We also conduct a series of simulated experiments, varying the planning method, target cardinality, environment, and sensor modality. Note to Practitioners-Teams of small robots have the potential to automate many information gathering tasks, relaying data back to a base station or human operator from multiple vantage points within an environment. The information gathering tasks we consider in this work are those in which the number of objects being sought is not known at the onset of exploration. Such tasks are common in security and surveillance, where the number of such objects is often zero; search and rescue, where, for example, the number of people trapped due to a natural disaster can be large; or smart building/smart city applications, where the data collection needs may be on an even larger scale. This paper seeks to address the problem of automating this data collection process, so that a team of mobile sensor platforms are able to autonomously explore a given environment in order to determine the number of objects of interest and their locations, while avoiding any explicit data association, i.e., matching individual measurements to targets.},

	Abstract = {Learning behavioral patterns for activities of daily living in a smart home environment can be challenged by the limited number of training data that may be available. This may be due to the infrequent repetition of routine activities (e.g., once daily), the expense of using observers to label activities, and the intrusion that would be caused by the presence of observers over long time periods. It is important, therefore, to make as much use of any labeled data that are collected, however, incomplete these data may be. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for learning behavioral patterns for multi-inhabitants living in a single smart home environment, by making full use of all limited labeled activities, including incomplete data resulting from unreliable low-level sensors in this environment. Through maximum-likelihood estimation, using Expectation-Maximization, we build a model that captures both environmental uncertainties from sensor readings and user uncertainties, including variations in how individuals carry out activities. Our algorithm outperforms models that cannot handle data incompleteness, with increasing performance gains as incompleteness increases. The approach also enables the impact of particular sensors to be assessed and can thus inform sensor maintenance and deployment.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel terrestrial retina-like neuromorphic sensor chip which can (1) perform irradiance and color detection via two pathways simultaneously and (2) can perform color change-intensity change disambiguation (CCICD). The irradiance detection pathway has a wide-dynamic detection range, spanning 3 orders of magnitude, and is robust to background light variations. The color detection pathway has a buried double junction photodiode as the photoreceptor followed by two parallel logarithmic I-V convertors whose outputs go to a differential amplifier. The output from this pathway is a color response which has roughly 50 nm resolution for wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm, and 22 nm resolution between 700-900 nm. With these two pathways, we can perform CCICD to determine if a change in the output of the irradiance pathway is because of irradiance change, color change, or both. This terrestrial retina-like neuromorphic sensor chip is implemented in AMI 1.5 mum technology, a standard CMOS fabrication process available at MOSIS.},

	Abstract = {The prediction and understanding of the erosion process of the Cu/W arcing contacts in high-voltage circuit breakers is important for the improvement of the breaker lifetime. The change of the contact geometry due to erosion is a main factor, which influences the lifetime. It is known that the ablation of contact material depends at least on parameters like the arcing current-amplitude, arcing time, total charge, and contact material properties. Based on experimental results, a method for an improved prediction of the erosion was derived. The experiments have been carried out in a SF6self-blast circuit breaker test device with commercial high-voltage circuit breaker contacts at a current amplitude up to 45kA RMS and arcing time up to 17ms. From the power balance at the electrodes, the material erosion due to evaporation is calculated. The resulting erosion rates are in good agreement to the experimental results and explain that the specific erosion scales with current, polarity, and the arcing time. This indicates that erosion in this range of arcing stress occurs mainly due to evaporation of contact material and less to emission of droplets},

	Abstract = {This brief presents two novel architectures, i.e., a nonlinear neural activation function and its derivative. Both are suitable for implementations of neurons in multilayer perceptron networks with an on-chip backpropagation learning algorithm. The activation function proposed shows minimal area and power consumption, can be considered as an approximation to the tanh(nx) function, and can be programmed to achieve any slope at the origin that is equal to or greater than 2. The derivative proposed also shows minimal area and maximizes its similarity, with the ideal derivative in the proximities of the origin being the best approximation for its degree of complexity. Both topologies are designed with subthreshold metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors in order to minimize power consumption. Likewise, they have been designed with balanced and fully differential topologies, so that external influences, offset, and distortion of even order are reduced. Moreover, a detailed analysis using the General Translinear Principle shows that the activation function is being affected by the body effect but the derivative function is immune to it. The activation function and the proposed derivative are thoroughly analyzed, and measured results are presented for our implementation on 0.5-mum AMI Semiconductor (AMIS) CMOS technology.},

Both constant bit rate and variable bit rate services are considered. A novel algorithm is developed for the resource allocation. Unlike existing solutions in literature, the proposed algorithm is distributed in nature, such that each network base station / access point can perform its own resource allocation to support the MTs according to their service classes. The coordination among different available wireless access networks' base stations is established via the MT multiple radio interfaces in order to provide the required bandwidth to each MT. A priority mechanism is employed, so that each network gives a higher priority on its resources to its own subscribers as compared to other users. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.},

We believe there is a need for an end-to-end approach reaching into the home as well. The Home Gateway (HG) as a key component of the home network is crucial for enabling the end-to-end solutions. UPnP-QoS has been proposed as an inhome solution for resource reservations. In this paper we assess a solution for automatic QoS reservations, on behalf of non-UPnP-QoS aware applications.

Advances in USB and wireless communication technologies have led USB-IF (USB Implementers Forum) to establishment of WUSB(Wireless USB) standard 1.0 that has wired USB's speed and compatibility in addition to wireless technology's convenience. The wireless USB provides convenience. However, due to mobility of WUSB devices in multi-hop environment, DRP (Distributed Reservation Protocol) reservation conflicts happen frequently among devices with three-hop distance. To solve this problem, we propose a new DRP reservation scheme using a new 2-hop range DRP Availability IE for three-hop mobility support in WUSB networks with ultrawideband (UWB) technology. It is shown by simulation results that throughputs of devices at frequent three-hop range DRP reservation conflicts are largely increased.},

We provide insight on this problem and reveal the "special protocol potion" we blended to heal home entertainment systems from it. Indeed, our recipe is simply composed by i) an enhanced access point, ii) standard protocol features, and iii) a smart use of the available information on the on-going traffic. This way, we are able to achieve low per-packet delays and high throughputs, thus satisfying the requirements of both real-time and elastic applications.

This work focuses on sensor networks, the main infrastructure for context-aware service in ubiquitous home network. The context-aware services will trigger intelligent and automatic services according to the context information based on the sensor platform context in the future home. This service requires accurate sensing information about the environment or user, (which is gathered via information exchange among sensors without human intervention) and management of this information. Hence, if the intelligent service develops configuration and control problems related to some sensed information. Such problem causes interaction issues which require an optimal solution. This paper's proposed model, implements a location tracking system, sensor information management (SIM) model, and mechanism, which can gather optimal information through the interaction within sensed information. Finally, context-aware services such as location tracking service and appliance control service presently adopt SIM mechanism. The SIM model implements a framework which comprise of foundation for intelligent physical agents (FIPA) based on intelligent agent platform, a sensor platform, an environment sensor node, and an ultra-sonic based active bat location sensor node.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a real-time voice service with the adaptive packet loss recovery scheme based on the H.323 protocol, which is one of the service functionalities of the hybrid residential gateway system. The proposed scheme analyzes the characteristics of packet losses based on the Gilbert model, and then describes a mechanism that can recover the lost audio packets with the offset redundant data. Using information periodically reported by a receiver, the sender dynamically adjusts the amount and the offset values of redundant data, with a constraint of minimizing the bandwidth consumption of links. Since the wireless environments could be often characterized by frequent and consecutive packet losses, loss recovery mechanisms need to deal with both the random and consecutive packet losses efficiently. To achieve this, the suggested mechanism uses relatively large and discontinuous exponential offset values. To verify the effectiveness of the mechanism, we extended and implemented RTP/RTCP protocols and applications in the hybrid residential gateway system. The experimental results show that our mechanism, with exponential offset, achieves remarkably low complete packet loss rate and adapts dynamically to the fluctuation of the packet loss pattern in the wired and wireless environments.},

To capture the randomness of the locally distributed generation, we develop a two-stage robust optimization model by considering an uncertainty set without probability information. Given that the problem is challenging, a nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is implemented to find an optimal solution. Some computational study, along with management insights, is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed model in dealing with the worst case situations.},

	Abstract = {Unobtrusive pressure sensors can be used for biological monitoring and long-term health assessment in smart homes. The challenge in detecting events from smart home data is that people have different mattresses, unlike in hospitals where bedding is standardized. This paper proposes to model central apneas using an under-mattress pressure sensor as a measuring instrument. The model uses three parameters, namely, a relative threshold and two time lengths, applied to a moving variance signal. The use of a relative threshold allows apneas to be detected under a variety of different conditions and improves results compared to hard-coded thresholds. The algorithm developed herein was applied to simulated apneas collected from pressure sensors placed under nine different mattresses. The parameters determined from the training set were applied to the test set and produced classification results of 0.78 positive predictive value (PPV) if the bed occupant's position is known and 0.75 PPV if the position is unknown. The use of the relative threshold approach overcomes the variability in mattress types found in smart homes.},

	Abstract = {Nowadays, electricity energy demands requested from down-stream sectors in a smart grid constantly increase. One way to meet those demands is use of home energy management systems (HEMS). By effectively scheduling major household appliances in response to demand response (DR) schemes, residents can save their electricity bills. In this paper, an advanced HEMS facilitated by a nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) technique with an automated nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II)-based multiobjective in-home power scheduling mechanism is proposed. The NILM as an electricity audit is able to nonintrusively estimate power consumed by each of monitored major household appliances at a certain period of time. Data identified by the NILM are very useful for DR implementation. For DR implementation, the NSGA-II-based multiobjective in-home power scheduling mechanism autonomously and meta-heuristically schedules monitored and enrolled major household appliances without user intervention. It is based on an analysis of the NILM with historical data with past trends. The experimental results reported in this paper reveal that the proposed advanced HEMS with the NILM assessed in a real-house environment with uncertainties is workable and feasible.},

	Abstract = {A key question in the design of intelligent environments is how a space can influence the actions of its users, and how such behavior can be learned. We present the results of experiments conducted as part of the Ada project, an interactive entertainment exhibit deployed at the Swiss national exhibition Expo.02. We used a learning model called distributed adaptive control (DAC) that is based on the animal learning paradigms of classical and operant conditioning. DAC has been developed using mobile robots in foraging tasks. Here, it was applied to the learning of effective cues for guiding visitors in a given direction. Our results show that, by using this learning mechanism, Ada was able to influence the behavior of visitors by learning to deploy particular types of cues. Many visitors could be induced to move toward a region of the space that they normally avoided visiting-an effect that can be seen as a spatial classification of visitors into interactive and noninteractive categories. In our analysis, we also introduce a measure of human activity that combines different types of data to capture key aspects of human behavior in interactive spaces.},

	Abstract = {Low rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) offer device level wireless connectivity. They bring to light a host of new applications as well as enhance existing applications. Due to their low cost, low power consumption and self-organization features, LR-WPANs are ideal for applications such as public security, battle field monitoring, inventory tracking, as well as home and office automation. Nevertheless, one critical issue, security, needs to be solved before LR-WPANs are commonly accepted. Pursuing security in LR-WPANs is a challenging task. On one hand, wireless communications are inherently susceptible to interception and interference. On the other hand, most devices in LR-WPANs are resource-constrained and lack physical safeguards. This paper presents a systematic analysis of the threats faced by LR-WPANs with respect to the protocol stack defined by IEEE 802.15.4 and the ZigBee Alliance. Attacks are modeled and their impacts are evaluated. Some security problems within the current LR-WPAN security architecture are identified and remedies are suggested. Countermeasures of various attacks are also given},

We propose network architecture to solve these problems. The network capability is divided to, minimum interface software embedded in appliance and a separated network adapter. This architecture gives appliances network-ready capabilities without increasing cost. Dispersed-tone power line communication (DTPLC) was also developed for no-new-wire network.

It is observed that when 20 cm of the insulated power line is surrounded with a conductive sheet, about 20 mJ of energy is harvested in 15 min with a 1 μF storage capacitor. An autonomous harvesting circuit was designed and built adopting an MEMS switch as a low leakage, low power consumption and hysteretic switch. It is demonstrated that the harvested energy is utilised to drive a commercial Zigbee-based wireless sensor module autonomously. Since it is easy and safe to install, the proposed stray electric field harvesting technology should greatly expand the field in which wireless sensors are required, such as home automation, smart grid, building energy management and structural health monitoring, as long as power lines are available nearby.},

	Abstract = {The number of video-surveillance applications has increased in the last years due to the increasing security requirements, especially in public buildings. In that sense, new types of applications have appeared with new services. As an example, digital applications allow the possibility of remotely controlling the video through internet. However, most of these applications are implemented ad-hoc. They are very tied to the programming level reducing thus their reusability, configurability and maintainability. In this setting, we propose a Model-Driven approach to develop video-surveillance applications. This approach is based on the utilization of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that allows the design of these applications at the modeling level. The utilization of models enhance the reusability of the services provided by the systems but also aims at managing their variability making them highly configurable. The models built based on this DSL are then used by model transformations that are able to automatically generate the configuration of the applications so that they may be dynamically reconfigured. Moreover, the approach provides different versions of the system, namely a standalone application, a web application or an application for mobile devices. All these applications allow the remote control of the video installation and the integration of external services such as SMS alerts, vehicles' plate recognition or smart home control.},

In this paper, we present a security-oriented cyber-physical state estimation (SCPSE) system, which, at each time instant, identifies the compromised set of hosts in the cyber network and the maliciously modified set of measurements obtained from power system sensors. SCPSE fuses uncertain information from different types of distributed sensors, such as power system meters and cyber-side intrusion detectors, to detect the malicious activities within the cyber-physical system. We implemented a working prototype of SCPSE and evaluated it using the IEEE 24-bus benchmark system. The experimental results show that SCPSE significantly improves on the scalability of traditional intrusion detection techniques by using information from both cyber and power sensors. Furthermore, SCPSE was able to detect all the attacks against the control network in our experiments.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a Growing Type-2 Fuzzy Classifier (GT2FC) for online rule learning from real-time data streams. While in batch rule learning, the training data are assumed to be drawn from a stationary distribution, in online rule learning, data can dynamically change over time becoming potentially nonstationary. To accommodate dynamic change, GT2FC relies on a new semi-supervised online learning algorithm called Growing Gaussian Mixture Model (2G2M). In particular, 2G2M is used to generate the type-2 fuzzy membership functions to build the type-2 fuzzy rules. GT2FC is designed to accommodate data online and to reconcile labeled and unlabeled data using self-learning. Moreover, GT2FC maintains low complexity of the rule base using online optimization and feature selection mechanisms. GT2FC is tested on data obtained from an ambient intelligence application, where the goal is to exploit sensed data to monitor the living space on behalf of the inhabitants. Because sensors are prone to faults and noise, type-2 fuzzy modeling is very suitable for dealing with such an application. Thus, GT2FC offers the advantage of dealing with uncertainty in addition to self-adaptation in an online manner. For illustration purposes, GT2FC is also validated on synthetic and classic UCI data-sets. The detailed empirical study shows that GT2FC performs very well under various experimental settings.},

	Abstract = {Public participation in and acceptance of routing decisions for electric transmission lines has delayed and prevented the construction of numerous lines in recent decades. A new method of public participation called structured public involvement (SPI), developed previously by two of the authors for routing other public infrastructure, has been adapted to routing electric transmission lines. SPI elicits and quantifies community values then routes the line according to these values and best engineering design practices. The process is done before any potential routes are ever considered by the transmission company and routing professionals, effectively allowing the public, in collaboration with experts, to determine the line route. This reduces the chances of line routing failure by simplifying the project and greatly accelerating the complex problem of comparing alternate line routes, and it facilitates public acceptance of a final route.},

	Abstract = {Reducing the standby power used by home appliances is critical in a household energy management system. Although significant effort has been made to minimize the standby power use of appliances, manual operation is still required to eliminate standby power usage. Additionally, the current regulation strategy of standby power typically focuses on real-power consumption, and it does not consider the apparent power and power factors. We propose an automatic standby power reduction system that is based on user-context profiling. Our system profiles and analyzes the occupancy pattern, as well as the appliance usage. The system then actively manages standby power utilization by predicting the probabilities of future appliance usage. We built a prototype smart meter to monitor and control the power lines. We also developed software that implements the proposed scheme. Our experiments, conducted for three to five weeks in four households, show that power consumption in standby mode can be reduced.},

	Abstract = {Wind flow regarded as a renewable energy source is present everywhere in indoor or open environments. A self-sustained flow-sensing microsystem is especially desirable in future applications of smart home, remote sensing and environmental monitoring. Piezoelectric thin films are commonly adopted in microenergy harvesters for converting the mechanical strain into an electrical charge based on the piezoelectric effect. It is also a promising candidate for flow sensors because of its passive nature, that is, the detectable output charge is a function of flow rate. The aim of this reported work has been to investigate the flow sensing and energy harvesting capabilities of a flexible piezoelectric Pb(Zr0.52, Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) microcantilever under wind flow. A self-sustained flow-sensing microsystem is possible by integrating the arrays of PZT microcantilevers, which measure the flow rate of ambient wind by one microcantilever and scavenge wind-flow energy as a power source by the rest.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for the robust classification of neurophysiological data into four emotional states collected during passive viewing of emotional evocative pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System. The proposed classification model is formed according to the current neuroscience trends, since it adopts the independency of two emotional dimensions, namely arousal and valence, as dictated by the bidirectional emotion theory, whereas it is gender-specific. A two-step classification procedure is proposed for the discrimination of emotional states between EEG signals evoked by pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, which also vary in their arousal/intensity levels. The first classification level involves the arousal discrimination. The valence discrimination is then performed. The Mahalanobis (MD) distance-based classifier and support vector machines (SVMs) were used for the discrimination of emotions. The achieved overall classification rates were 79.5% and 81.3% for the MD and SVM, respectively, significantly higher than in previous studies. The robust classification of objective emotional measures is the first step toward numerous applications within the sphere of human-computer interaction.},

	Abstract = {Home Network-Attached Storage (NAS) provides an easy way for data sharing and backup among multiple consumer electronic devices in home networks. Because of large capacity and cost effectiveness, disks are widely adopted in home NAS devices. In addition, data writes are common for many home NAS devices since these devices are usually used for data storage and backup. A writeback policy selects which dirty buffers are to be flushed to the disk, which is critical to the system performance under write-intensive workloads. In this paper, an intelligent writeback policy for home NAS called TESA is proposed. In contrast to most existing writeback policies, TESA considers both temporal and spatial information of the dirty buffers to improve the writeback performance. Considering the temporal information helps to reduce the frequency of writing back recently used dirty buffers, and hence leads to reduced write traffic. Considering the spatial information causes a reduction in the overall seek time and rotation delay of the dirty buffer writeback. The TESA writeback policy was implemented on a NAS evaluation board running Linux kernel. The performance results shows that TESA yields a significant performance improvement (i.e., up to 33.1%) over the original writeback policy of Linux. Moreover, TESA outperforms the policy that considers only the temporal information of the dirty buffers by up to 21.0%, and it also has up to 10.9% performance improvement over a previous policy that considers both the temporal and spatial information.},

Experimental results derived from a reference prototype are presented. These demonstrate the practicality of the underlying approach. The potential to develop new cloud services for "social" home networks is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {In a home network, various devices coexist in heterogeneous networks, such as IP, IEEE1394, PLC, Bluetooth, ZigBee, UWB, and IrDA, all of which lack interoperability due to their different physical transmission characteristics and protocols. In home networks where an unrestricted combination of services and resources among the devices is essential to offer services that meet the users' requirements, free interworking among the devices must be guaranteed. This paper proposes an interoperability model which provides unrestricted advertisement, discovery and access of the resources among heterogeneous devices on the basis of a virtual overlay network which supports seamless communication among the devices on home networks. Compared with conventional approach models, the model offers improvements in terms of its capacity to support network and device types, its reliability.},

	Abstract = {We propose in this paper a computer vision-based posture recognition method for home monitoring of the elderly. The proposed system performs human detection prior to the posture analysis; posture recognition is performed only on a human silhouette. The human detection approach has been designed to be robust to different environmental stimuli. Thus, posture is analyzed with simple and efficient features that are not designed to manage constraints related to the environment but only designed to describe human silhouettes. The posture recognition method, based on fuzzy logic, identifies four static postures and is robust to variation in the distance between the camera and the person, and to the person's morphology. With an accuracy of 74.29% of satisfactory posture recognition, this approach can detect emergency situations such as a fall within a health smart home.},

In this paper, a novel signal processing method based on wavelet packet analysis is proposed to combat the adverse communication environment over power lines. A comparison research between wavelet transform and wavelet packet transform is presented. Since wavelet packet decomposition can provide more precise frequency resolution than wavelet decomposition, this paper proposes to use the wavelet packet analysis to deal with the highly polluted PLC communication signal. A hardware structure for the PLC system is presented as an experimental platform for sampling an actual communication signal. Simulation results based on these kinds of actual communication signals show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	Abstract = {Communication using power line as a medium of signal transmission offers a convenient and inexpensive solution for multimedia signal transmission and control applications in smart home networking. This work presents a novel analog spread-spectrum (SS) scheme for physical-layer interface in home networking. The proposed communication scheme uses a chaotic system to modulate the information signal for wideband transmission. The wideband spectral property of the transmitted chaotic signal adds robustness to the proposed scheme against the hostile power-line environment that is characterized by non-Gaussian noise and multipath propagation. By exploiting the ergodic property of chaotic signals, a simple noncoherent receiver is developed here. Not only does the proposed analog scheme demonstrate satisfactory communication performance, but it can also be implemented with simple hardware and low manufacturing cost, which is an important consideration for cost-effective home networking. The proposed noncoherent SS system does not involve quantization and complex synchronization process and, hence, it is more efficient in transmitting analog multimedia signals compared to the conventional SS system. Performance analyses illustrate the superior communication performance of the proposed analog SS system over the conventional SS scheme for multimedia signal transmission in a power-line home networking environment.},

	Abstract = {A user may use a software bundle provided by vendors to control consumer electronics (CEs) in a home network environment. Software was developed as a bundle composed of various components and registered to an OSGi service registry, thus, a user can select a suitable bundle and implement it in a service gateway. There's no need to consider hardware when using a single bundle, because this was handled by hardware, service gateway specifications. But using several bundles to implement a business process for simultaneous control of various CEs is a different matter. If hardware resource sharing was not considered in development, then quality of service (QoS) of the business process cannot be guaranteed. Thus, we need an evaluation method for a user-defined business process, to guarantee QoS in business process modeling. This paper suggests a representative evaluation algorithm by considering metadata about bundle distribution as evaluation items, such as method response time, component response time, memory space and CPU capacity. Also, this paper suggests a business process simulator. It enables constructions of simulations for the efficiency of evaluation items and methods. A user uses a simulator to select a suitable bundle for hardware and easily makes and verifies a suitable business process for their goals.},

Using vital sign monitor medical devices as an example, we demonstrate that our intrusion detection technique can effectively trade false positives off for a high detection probability to cope with more sophisticated and hidden attackers to support ultra safe and secure MCPS applications. Moreover, through a comparative analysis, we demonstrate that our behavior-rule specification-based IDS technique outperforms two existing anomaly-based techniques for detecting abnormal patient behaviors in pervasive healthcare applications.},

	Abstract = {Nowadays home automation, with its increased availability, reliability and with its ever reducing costs is gaining momentum and is starting to become a viable solution for enabling people with disabilities to autonomously interact with their homes and to better communicate with other people. However, especially for people with severe mobility impairments, there is still a lack of tools and interfaces for effective control and interaction with home automation systems, and general--purpose solutions are seldom applicable due to the complexity, asynchronicity, time dependent behavior, and safety concerns typical of the home environment. This paper focuses on user--environment interfaces based on the eye tracking technology, which often is the only viable interaction modality for users as such. We propose an eye-based interface tackling the specific requirements of smart environments, already outlined in a public Recommendation issued by the COGAIN European Network of Excellence. The proposed interface has been implemented as a software prototype based on the ETU universal driver, thus being potentially able to run on a variety of eye trackers, and it is compatible with a wide set of smart home technologies, handled by the Domotic OSGi Gateway. A first interface evaluation, with user testing sessions, has been carried and results show that the interface is quite effective and usable without discomfort by people with almost regular eye movement control.},

PLC has been a very important interdiscipline topic for power, communications, industrial, and automation engineers and researchers since the 1980s. Designing and planning optimized or standard PLC systems require information and data regarding signal attenuations, load variations, and communication performance for various locations of the world which have different power networks. In this study, PLC system is modeled by ABCD matrix and simulated via electronics workbench. In order to obtain data from Turkey's power lines, signal measurements at the frequencies of 50-200 kHz are carried out. The effects of load, frequency, line length, and the distribution transformers are examined. The properties of home appliances used in an average Turkish household are experimentally determined. System performance in terms of the bit error probability are calculated for FSK modulation.},

	Abstract = {Smart metering and fine-grained energy data are one of the major enablers for future smart grid and improved energy efficiency in smart homes. Using the information provided by smart meter power draw, valuable information can be extracted as disaggregated appliance power draws by non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). NILM allows to identify appliances according to their power characteristics in the total power consumption of a household, measured by one sensor, the smart meter. In this paper, we present an NILM approach, where the appliance states are estimated by particle filtering (PF). PF is used for nonlinear and non-Gaussian disturbed problems and is suitable to estimate the appliance state. ON/OFF appliances, multistate appliances, or combinations of them are modeled by hidden Markov models, and their combinations result in a factorial hidden Markov model modeling the household power demand. We evaluate the PF-based NILM approach on synthetic and on real data from a well-known dataset to show that our approach achieves an accuracy of 90% on real household power draws.},

	Abstract = {Bridging IEEE 1394 buses is becoming important since it can be used to provide wireless connectivity among 1394 devices. Unfortunately, existing bridge mechanisms, such as the IEEE 1394.1 bridge and the transparent bridge, have practical limitations. The former does not support interoperability with legacy 1394 devices and the latter requires a new hardware chipset for bridge implementation. We thus propose a new bridge mechanism called a mirroring bridge to overcome these limitations. It supports interoperability with legacy 1394 devices by emulating remote nodes inside a bridge and via packet address translation that can be implemented through software. We have implemented the proposed bridge mechanism and have succeeded in interconnecting legacy 1394 devices over an experimental WiMedia UWB network. The experimental result showed that the average throughput of the mirroring bridge is 188.7 Mbps, which is 94.4% of the maximum throughput of the UWB chipset used.},

	Abstract = {The popularity of ZigBee devices continues to grow in home automation, transportation, traffic management, and Industrial Control System (ICS) applications given their low-cost and low-power. However, the decentralized architecture of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for network intrusion detection and prevention. In the past, ZigBee device authentication reliability was enhanced by Radio Frequency-Distinct Native Attribute (RF-DNA) fingerprinting using a Fisher-based Multiple Discriminant Analysis and Maximum Likelihood (MDA-ML) classification process to distinguish between devices in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. However, MDA-ML performance inherently degrades when RF-DNA features do not satisfy Gaussian normality conditions, which often occurs in real-world scenarios where radio frequency (RF) multipath and interference from other devices is present. We introduce non-parametric Random Forest (RndF) and Multi-Class AdaBoost (MCA) ensemble classifiers into the RF-DNA fingerprinting arena, and demonstrate improved ZigBee device authentication. Results are compared with parametric MDA-ML and Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization-Improved (GRLVQI) classifier results using identical input feature sets. Fingerprint dimensional reduction is examined using three methods, namely a pre-classification Kolmogorov-Smirnoff Test (KS-Test), a post-classification RndF feature relevance ranking, and a GRLVQI feature relevance ranking. Using the ensemble methods, an SNR=18.0 dB improvement over MDA-ML processing is realized at an arbitrary correct classification rate (%C) benchmark of %C=90%; for all SNR ∈ [0, 30] dB considered, %C improvement over MDA-ML ranged from 9% to 24%. Relative to GRLVQI processing, ensemble methods again provided improvement for all SNR, with a best improvement of %C=10% achieved at the lowest tested SNR=0.0 dB. Network penetration, measured using rogue ZigBee devices, show that at the SNR=12.0 dB (%C=90%) the ensemble methods correctly reject 31 of 36 rogue access attempts based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and an arbitrary Rogue Accept Rate of . This performance is better than MDA-ML, and GRLVQI which rejected 25/36, and 28/36 rogue access attempts respectively. The key benefit of ensemble method processing is improved rogue rejection in noisier environments; gains of 6.0 dB, and 18.0 dB are realized over GRLVQI, and MDA-ML, respectively. Collectively considering the demonstrated %C and rogue rejection capability, the use of ensemble methods improves ZigBee network authentication, and enhances anti-spoofing protection afforded by RF-DNA fingerprinting.},

	Abstract = {Recently, there is a trend on developing mobile applications based on service-oriented architecture in numerous application domains, such as telematics and smart home. Although efforts have been made on developing composite SOAP services, little emphasis has been put on invoking and composing a combination of SOAP, non-SOAP, and non-Web services into a composite process to execute complex tasks on various mobile devices. Main challenges are two-fold: one is how to invoke and compose heterogeneous Web services with various protocols and content types, including SOAP, RESTful, and OSGi services; and the other is how to integrate non-Web services, like Web contents and mobile applications, into a composite service process. In this work, we propose an approach to invoking and composing SOAP, non-SOAP, and non-Web services with two key features: an extended BPEL engine bundled with adapters to enable direct invocation and composition of SOAP, RESTful and OSGi services based on Adapter pattern; and two transformation mechanisms devised to enable conversion of Web contents and Android activities into OSGi services. In the experimental evaluations, we demonstrate network traffic and turnaround time of our approach are better than those of the traditional ones.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates joint scheduling problem of large-scale smart appliances and batteries (e.g., in a smart building), to minimize electricity payment, user's dissatisfaction and battery loss under kinds of constraints. Due to the binary nature of charge and discharge states of battery, this problem is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer nonlinear program. In order to solve it efficiently, a distributed mixed optimization approach is proposed. First, Lagrangian relaxation is applied to decompose the original problem into two sets of subproblems, each of which corresponds to scheduling on appliance/battery. Then, the battery scheduling subproblem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and tackled by Benders decomposition. The main advantages of the proposed approach are the distributed implementation and low computational complexity, as shown by simulations.},

	Abstract = {In the last years, the research effort of the scientific community to study systems for ambient intelligence has been really strong. Usually, the systems developed so far base their analysis on images acquired by automatic cameras. In this paper, we propose a way to develop new smart systems that are able to actively decide both what to see and how to see it. In particular, the main idea is to tune the acquisition parameters on the basis of what the system desires to acquire. The regulation strategy is based on two camera parameters, focus and iris. It aims to identify an optimal sequence of steps to enhance the acquisition quality of an object of interest. To this end, a hierarchy of neural networks has been employed first to select which parameter must be regulated then to adjust it. The proposed solution can be applied to both static and moving cameras. The results show how the proposed technique can be applied to images acquired by a moving camera with zoom capabilities for surveillance purposes.},

There is significant ongoing work to increase the achievable data rates using VLC, to standardize it and integrate it within existing network infrastructures. The future of VLC systems depends on the ability to fabricate low cost transceiver components and to realize the promise of high data rates. This paper reports the design and fabrication of integrated transmitter and receiver components. The transmitter uses a two dimensional individually addressable array of micro light emitting diodes (μLEDs) and the receiver uses an integrated photodiode array fabricated in a CMOS technology. A preliminary result of a MIMO system implementation operating at a data rate of 1 Gbps is demonstrated. This paper also highlights the challenges in achieving highly parallel data communication along with the possible bottlenecks in integrated approaches.},

The protocol is especially tailored for industrial and home automation networks, and in many application contexts, it offers several advantages compared with other solutions targeted at similar purposes. RBIS has been conceived to rely on conventional Wi-Fi equipment and, in particular, on unmodified access points. It is based on the master/slave approach and follows the receiver/receiver paradigm. An implementation of RBIS-carried out completely in software and based on timestamps taken at the interrupt handler level-has been developed, which achieves a synchronization error below 3 μs. Then, a simple distributed hard real-time control application has been setup, which consists in two PCs running real-time application interface for Linux (RTAI) and connected through Wi-Fi. The actuation error, measured on the generation of synchronous pulses, is strictly below 13 μs.},

Virtually all of the audio and video devices in the home can be controlled by remote. However, despite many efforts by home-automation enthusiasts, extending the remote realm beyond these entertainment devices has been less successful. The extension of remote control functionality throughout the average dwelling requires the engagement of a custom installation company, which will for a price enable all your white goods, brown goods, lights, curtains, and garage doors to be controlled by a single box of tricks. The modern reality of course is that we all have a handful of remotes jostling for position on our chair arms. The one drawback when we do finally slump down after a hard day's work, is the inevitable fumble down the side of the sofa for the right remote. Not only this, but they all look the same.

	Abstract = {Technology, science, and engineering continue to redefine physical world capabilities. Take mobility of humans, for example. In the 20th century, transportation systems moved us to unimaginable distances, speeds on earth and made us set foot on the Moon. Star Trek popularized teleportation, a fictitious technology that instantly allows us to "go where no person has gone before." Before end of the century, Internet and wireless networking helped to create the parallel "cyber world," virtually "teleporting" us great distances to interact with remote objects, people, and places. In the new millennium, our restless society's need for such ground-breaking capabilities in time and space has never been greater. Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a promising new class of systems that deeply embed cyber capabilities in the physical world, either on humans, infrastructure or platforms, to transform interactions with the physical world. Advances in the cyber world such as communications, networking, sensing, computing, storage, and control, as well as in the physical world such as materials, hardware, and renewable "green" fuels, are all rapidly converging to realize this class of highly collaborative computational systems that are reliant on sensors and actuators to monitor and effect change.Tomorrow's CPS is expected to enrich cyber-physical interactions by intimately coupling assets and dynamics of the physical and engineered systems with the computing and communications of cyber systems, at grand scales and depths from nanosystems to geographically dispersed systems-of-systems. It must be able to adapt rapidly to anomalies in the environment and embrace the evolution of technologies while still providing critical assertions of performance and other constraints.},

	Abstract = {Autonomy and adaptability are key features of intelligent agents. Many applications of intelligent agents, such as the control of ambient intelligence environments and autonomous intelligent robotic systems, require the processing of information coming in from many available sensors to produce adequate output responses in changing scenarios. Autonomy, in these cases, applies not only to the ability of the agent to produce correct outputs without human guidance, but also to its ubiquity and/or portability, low-power consumption and integrability. In this sense, an embedded electronic system implementation paradigm can be applied to the design of autonomous intelligent agents in order to satisfy the above mentioned characteristics. However, processing complex computational intelligence algorithms with tight delay constraints in resource-constrained and low power embedded systems is a challenging engineering problem. In this paper a single-chip intelligent agent based on a computationally efficient neuro-fuzzy information processing core is described. The system has been endowed with an information preprocessing module based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that permits a substantial reduction of the input space dimensionality with little loss of modeling capability. Moreover, the PCA module has been tested as a means to achieve deep adaptability in changing environment dynamics and to endow the agent with fault tolerance in the presence of sensor failures. For data driven trials and research, a data set obtained from an experimental intelligent inhabited environment has been used as a benchmark system.},

	Abstract = {Elderly support ambient assisted living environments are focal in healthcare computing. Critical to their implementation is transparent integration of diverse hardware and its ubiquitous communication with multiple software components. Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device na{\"\i}ve, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers' data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework's architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework's design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments.},

Reducing the gap between the real and digital world makes the factory environment more flexible, more adaptive, but also demand broader skill of human workers. Interdisciplinary competencies from engineering, information technology, and computer science are required in order to understand and manage the diverse interrelations between physical objects and their digital counterpart. This paper proposes a system architecture for a mixed-reality based learning environment, which combines physical objects and visualization of its digital content via Augmented Reality. It allows to make the dynamic interrelations between real and digital factory visible and tangible. The proposed learning environment is not meant to work as a stand-alone solution, but should enrich existing academic and advanced training curricula.},

This allows the applications to adapt themselves to the entities, thus avoiding to overflow them with inquires and information. The analysis of trails, the context-aware history of actions, can further improve the relevance of information. This paper proposes a model that allows applications to register entities' actions in trails and infer profile information from these trails, using semantic interoperability and thus allowing different applications to share information and infer a unified profile. An application was developed and integrated with two different softwares in a scenario of ubiquitous learning, where the student profiles were dynamically updated, allowing them to better adapt to the environment. The contributions of this model are the use of trails for extracting profiles and the capability of managing dynamic inference rules for profile generation.},

	Abstract = {An increasing amount of attention is being paid by local public administrations, national and federal governments as well as by international institutions, such as the European Commission, to improve personal mobility within urban environments through the use of public transports. Improving mobility of people through increased use of public transportation has a number of advantages since it is strategic to reduce energy consumption, to lower emissions and pollution levels, to improve public safety, and to dramatically reduce congestions and road traffic. Reducing private transportation clearly bring significant benefits not only to citizens' quality of life and public health but it also results in a more efficient urban system as a whole, with consequent substantial economic benefits at the wider societal level. Based on this assumption, this paper presents a so-called personal mobility assistant, i.e. a software for smartphones and tablets which promotes use of public transport by helping user identify the best travel option across a multi-modal transport network, through a user-friendly interface that intelligently adjusts to user preferences and to contextual information.},

	Abstract = {Over the last 15 years, computerized controls have become more and more common in our homes. The smart home looks at expanding the use of the computers into the difference parts of the home, creating a network that can be easily and conveniently controlled. The use of computer controls removes the need to actually flick a switch and allows elements of the home to respond automatically to the people living in it. Successful control and heating ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is a primary concern in building project: in order to achieve the required comfort and energy efficiency goals, a lot of variables must be coordinated and kept at particular pre-designed operation points. The management control systems can be applied to try to achieve optimum settings for different operations in the complicated systems. To optimal settings must balance three aspects: (1) comfort, (2) energy efficiency, and (3) performance margins on order to be able to quickly adapt to unexpected disturbances. This work has used TRNSYS software package to model a HVAC system composed by a geothermal heat pump (GHP) and several fan-coils (FC) for a typical distribution of offices in the area of the Mediterranean Sea. In this model, a control structure has been designed using various configurations of cascade control to incorporate extra sensors and actuators in order to achieve PMV specifications and save energy.},

In the beginning of this article, we define the whole problem in which the topics are: energy, comfort and control. Next, we briefly present the conventional control systems in buildings and their advantages and disadvantage. We will also see how the development of intelligent control systems has improved the efficiency of control systems for the management of indoor environment including user preferences. This paper presents a survey exploring state of the art control systems in buildings. Attention will be focused on the design of agent-based intelligent control systems in building environments. In particular, this paper presents a multi-agent control system (MACS). This advanced control system is simulated using TRNSYS/MATLAB. The simulation results show that the MACS successfully manage the user's preferences for thermal and illuminance comfort, indoor air quality and energy conservation.},

	Abstract = {Context
The prevalence of computing and communication technologies, combined with the availability of sophisticated and highly specialised software packages from software vendors has made package acquisition a viable option for many organisations. While some research has addressed the factors that influence the selection of the software acquisition method in large organisations, little is known about the factors affecting SMEs.
Objective
To provide an understanding of factors that affect the decision process of software acquisition for SMEs. It is expected that results from this study: (i) will assist the SME decision process for software acquisition, and (ii) will assist policy makers in terms of developing appropriate guidelines for SME software acquisition.
Method
A positivist research perspective has been adopted involving semi-structured interviews in eight SMEs in Thailand with the interviewees assigning to each of the potential factors.
Results
The study found that the following factors affect both SMEs and large organisations: requirements fit, cost, scale and complexity, commoditization/flexibility, time, in-house experts, support structure, and operational factors. Factors mainly applying to large organisations were strategic role of the software, intellectual property concerns, and risk, Factors particularly relevant to SMEs (ubiquitous systems, availability of free download, and customizable to specific government/tax regulations).
Conclusion
The results suggest that: (i) when deciding on their software acquisition method, SMEs are generally less likely to pursue a long-term vision compared with larger organisations, possibly because SMEs mainly serve their local markets; and (ii) contrary to the large organisations, the role that the IT plays in SMEs may not be as vital to the SMEs' core business processes, to their supply chains, and/or to the management of their customer relationship. Furthermore, neither the level of technological intensity nor size of the SME appears to affect the ranks given by the interviewees for the various factors.},

	Abstract = {Currently available application frameworks that target the automatic design of real-time embedded software are poor in integrating functional and non-functional requirements for mobile and ubiquitous systems. In this work, we present the internal architecture and design flow of a newly proposed framework called Verifiable Embedded Real-Time Application Framework (VERTAF), which integrates three techniques namely software component-based reuse, formal synthesis, and formal verification. Component reuse is based on a formal unified modeling language (UML) real-time embedded object model. Formal synthesis employs quasi-static and quasi-dynamic scheduling with multi-layer portable efficient code generation, which can output either real-time operating systems (RTOS)-specific application code or automatically generated real-time executive with application code. Formal verification integrates a model checker kernel from state graph manipulators (SGM), by adapting it for embedded software. The proposed architecture for VERTAF is component-based which allows plug-and-play for the scheduler and the verifier. The architecture is also easily extensible because reusable hardware and software design components can be added. Application examples developed using VERTAF demonstrate significantly reduced relative design effort as compared to design without VERTAF, which also shows how high-level reuse of software components combined with automatic synthesis and verification increases design productivity.},

Cars have no power constraints and they can be instrumented with high end computational units and graphic devices. The deployment at scale of urban vehicular systems, however, requires a careful design able to consider challenges across several domains. Vehicular systems are arguably a prominent example of cyber-physical systems. The development of such systems requires a truly multidisciplinary approach and a close integration between the application, communication, and physical domains. Hardware and software mounted on vehicles will face a harsh physical and communication environment that will greatly affect all the system components. In this paper we report on the challenges and opportunities for multimedia vehicular urban sensing systems based on our field experiences in Macao (China) and Los Angels (USA). We designed and built the components for a pollution monitoring system able to support closed-loop optimization between pollution and traffic management. Our initial set of prototype vehicles are now running in the city of Macao and they are measuring the air parameters as well as the urban traffic. The paper aims at exposing some of the issues encountered, outlining the problems of a city wide deployment, and augmenting our in-field experience with the results from large scale simulation studies.},

	Abstract = {Supporting formal and informal meetings with digital information and ubiquitous software systems every day becomes increasingly mandatory. These meetings require that the integration of devices participating in the meeting and the information flow among them should be done as seamless as possible to avoid jeopardizing the natural interactions among participants. Trying to contribute to address such a challenge, this article presents a framework that allows devices integration and smooth information flow. This framework, named Clairvoyance, particularly integrates mobile computing devices and large-screen TVs through a mobile ad hoc network, and thus it eases the implementation of shared displays intended to be used in formal and informal meetings. Clairvoyance provides a set of services through an API, which can be used to develop ubiquitous applications that support meetings in particular scenarios. The preliminary evaluation of this framework considered its usage to implement a ubiquitous system that supports social meetings among friends or relatives. According to developers, the framework is easy to use and it provided all required services for such an application. The solution obtained was then utilized by end-users in simulated meetings. The evaluation results indicate that the Clairvoyance services were suitable to support the informal meetings, and that the devices integration and information flow were transparent for the end-users.},

	Abstract = {Infohabitants of the connected information systems include individuals, organizations, smart appliances, smart buildings, and other smart systems, as well as virtual entities acting on their behalf. They can best be represented by software agents. Hence, realistic cognitive abilities of software agents such as influence of personality to decision making and problem solving is of practical computational importance. In this article, two characteristics are added to software agents with personality: dynamic personality and the relationships of personality trait openness with both problem solving ability and cognitive complexity. The last characteristic of openness leads to its impact to dynamic modification of problem solving ability. In this article, an implementation of a fuzzy agent with personality is realized in Java environment to show personality descriptors, personality factors, personality style, and problem solving success consequently. Furthermore, a prototype system is presented to update personality facets and respective personality trait openness which can affect problem solving ability.},

These services have improved a great number of aspects related to pervasive systems such as saving resources, efficiency, reliability, scalability and low power consumption. In this paper, μSMS middleware, using an event-based service model, is presented. This novel approach makes up the design requirements previously mentioned by implementing a dynamic memory kernel and a variable payload multiplexing mechanism for the information events in order to provide advanced services. The results obtained over real-world deployments, especially those related with provision of e-Health services, reflect a significant improvement over other similar proposals, such as the RUNES approach: 50% lower memory overhead, 53% lower software components load time and 12% lower event's propagation time.},

	Abstract = {Model updating procedures are traditionally performed off-line. With the significant recent advances in embedded systems and the related real-time computing capabilities, online or real-time, model updating can be performed to inform decision making and controller actions. The applications for real-time model updating are mainly in the areas of (i) condition diagnosis and prognosis of engineering systems; and (ii) control systems that benefit from accurate modeling of the system plant. Herein, the development of a cyber-physical real-time model updating experimental platform, including real-time computing environment, model updating algorithm, hardware architecture and testbed, is described. Results from two challenging experimental implementations are presented to illustrate the performance of this cyber-physical platform in achieving the goal of updating nonlinear systems in real-time. The experiments consider typical nonlinear engineering systems that exhibit hysteresis. Among the available algorithms capable of identification of such complex nonlinearities, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is selected for these experiments as an effective method to update nonlinear dynamic system models under realistic conditions. The implementation of the platform is discussed for successful completion of these experiments, including required timing constraints and overall evaluation of the system.},

Hence this new facade offers additional features with respect to the most popular currently used glass facades, which have fixed solar transmittance indeed. The novel technology is made possible by the creation of an additional 1.5-mm-thick sliding shielding liquid, which flows internally, in order to dynamically adapt the window's solar transmittance. As compared with competitive technologies, this shielding system has low manufacturing costs, is durable, is completely reversible and always transparent, irrespective of its transmittance state. Specifically, the manufacture of a full size window prototype and the engineering of the window was carried out; moreover, glass pane bending when subject to hydrostatic pressure was eventually assessed. All this information has been used to set up the industrial process needed for its manufacturing.},

The properties, dependencies, locations, and installation conditions have to be properly specified for this composition and its deployment. Due to the great variance in services and eHome configurations there is a need for tool support for eHome systems. In this paper we address the software development issues of such tools. In our approach we base the software development on graph rewriting language techniques. Based on our experience, we consider this approach as a possibility to improve the productivity of the eHome system tool development. With the aid of Fujaba, we created a model capable of specifying functions, devices, environments, and value-added services. Furthermore, we used Fujaba to create the activities as graph rewriting rules for model modifications. To apply the model and to carry out the actual specification for a particular eHome and particular appliances we generated the eHomeSpecificator tool from the model and its activities. This tool can serve as a base for a wider range of tools supporting eHome systems.},

	Abstract = {This paper briefly explores the expected impact of the `Global Drivers' (such as population demographics, food security; energy security; community security and safety), and the role of sustainability engineering in mitigating the potential effects of these Global Drivers. The message of the paper is that sustainability requires a significant input from Ergonomics/Human Factors, but the profession needs some expansion in its thinking in order to make this contribution. Creating a future sustainable world in which people experience an acceptable way of life will not happen without a large input from manufacturing industry into all the Global Drivers, both in delivering products that meet sustainability criteria (such as durability, reliability, minimised material requirement and low energy consumption), and in developing sustainable processes to deliver products for sustainability (such as minimum waste, minimum emissions and low energy consumption). Appropriate changes are already being implemented in manufacturing industry, including new business models, new jobs and new skills. Considerable high-level planning around the world is in progress and is bringing about these changes; for example, there is the US `Advanced Manufacturing National Program' (AMNP)', the German `Industrie 4.0' plan, the French plan `la nouvelle France industrielle' and the UK Foresight publications on the `Future of Manufacturing'. All of these activities recognise the central part that humans will continue to play in the new manufacturing paradigms; however, they do not discuss many of the issues that systems ergonomics professionals acknowledge. This paper discusses a number of these issues, highlighting the need for some new thinking and knowledge capture by systems ergonomics professionals. Among these are ethical issues, job content and skills issues. Towards the end, there is a summary of knowledge extensions considered necessary in order that systems ergonomists can be fully effective in this new environment, together with suggestions for the means to acquire and disseminate the knowledge extensions.},

Applications and services, which run in these kinds of highly dynamic environments, should be aware of and adapt to their contexts. Context-aware applications improve and enrich people's interactions with devices, computers and other people. In this paper, design and development of iConAwa, which is an intelligent context-aware multi-agent system proactively providing mobile users with context-aware information and services, is described. In iConAwa, mobile users can get information and services about nearby resources (attraction points) according to their context and also communicate with each other by exchanging messages. Context and point of interest ontologies are developed in OWL. Context and points of interest are modelled in a flexible and extensible way by the developed ontology models. Knowledge sharing and knowledge reuse are also provided by using these ontology models. iConAwa makes use of rule-based context reasoning which provides derivation of high level implicit context from low level explicit context. With this approach context reasoning is decoupled from the source code of the system. JADE agent development framework is used to develop the agents and Jena semantic web framework is used to manipulate ontologies and for rule based reasoning.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Component-based development of embedded system software has proven to be a cost effective methodology, and many general component technologies are available from both industry and academia. Often times such modular updating and upgrading can be too expensive (in cost, manpower, and down time) to execute. This is especially true for safety- and time-critical applications where rigorous requalification processes are necessary after a software change. A theoretical approach to incremental or modular certification would provide the ability to use particular subsystems in a modular fashion, but this requires both functional and time behaviour independence of the module. In this research a component-based software model was used to develop incrementally updateable multiprocessor architecture for a reconfigurable FPGA computing technology. The developed system architecture was designed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and evaluated through a case study of an embedded home automation control system. A new functionality was added to the initial system, and later reconfigured into the FPGA-chip as a new processor-module. Different memory architectures of the multiprocessor system and their relations to the changes in temporal behaviour of the system were tested and measured. With the best memory configuration, the average change in internal temporal behaviour of the system processors of initial functionality after system upgrading was smaller than 0.5 μs.},

Despite all the time that has passed since Weiser's vision, ubiquitous computing still has a long way ahead to become a pervasive reality. One of the reasons for this may be the lack of widely accepted formal models capable of capturing and analyzing the complexity of the new paradigm. We propose a simple Petri Net based model to study some of its main characteristics. We model both devices and software components as a special kind of coloured Petri Nets, located in locations, that can move to other locations and synchronize with other co-located nets, offering and requesting services. We obtain an amenable model for ubiquitous computing, due to its graphical representation. We present our proposal in a progressive way, first presenting a basic model where coordination is formalized by the synchronized firing of pairs of compatible transitions that offer and request a specific service, and ad hoc networks are modeled by constraining mobility by the dynamic acquisition of locality names. Next, we introduce a mechanism for the treatment of robust security properties, namely the generation of fresh private names, to be used for authentication properties.},

	Abstract = {The introduction of computing tools to Architecture, Engineering & Construction (AEC) industry has enabled the professionals to navigate successfully from traditional design/drafting to Computer Aided Design/Drafting (CADD). Furthermore, the industry is slowly transitioning towards sophisticated Building Information Modelling (BIM), which necessitates the integration of domain specific knowledge into the BIM authoring tools. The approach presented in this paper elucidates the development of rule-based BIM objects which allows a designer to create building models within the rules of Modular Coordination (MC). With this development, a designer will be able to use MC standards to size and locate building objects in a modular reference frame. Integration of rules of MC with BIM authoring tool will enhance the design process and allow designers to automate some complex modelling/documentation activities requiring no design expertise. The development of rule-based BIM objects exploits the parametric modelling capabilities of BIM authoring tools in addition to visual programming tool to automate the modelling process. The research first explains development of rule based BIM objects which is extended to streamline the overall design process. The presented approach discusses the customization of BIM authoring tool for modelling a residential facility in MC using axial planning of structural elements. In the prototype system, the designer is guided by specific rules and constraints while providing sufficient options to develop variegated configuration. The integration of design rules of MC standards with BIM application will be influential to increase radical use of BIM for built environment especially in the prefabrication industry.},

	Abstract = {The use of personal protective equipment (PPEs) in the construction industry is necessary to guarantee the safety of the workers. However, this equipment is not usually worn properly. Nowadays, the only control performed over the use of PPEs consists of a visual inspection. This paper introduces a novel cyber-physical system (CPS) to check in real time how the PPEs are worn by the workers. In order to perform such a control, an architecture composed of a wireless local area network and a body area network is considered. A system prototype was developed by using Zigbee and RFID technologies that support the deployment of both kinds of networks. The worker carries a microcontroller-based device that detects the presence of the PPEs and sends a report to a central unit where alerts and historical data are generated. This paper is basically aimed at introducing the monitoring system, describing its hardware and software components, and analyzing the coverage and consumption of the worker's device.},

Universal mobile interaction devices will increase the flexibility of the service men during their maintenance task. Although this greater flexibility can improve the maintenance processes it also results in new problems for the users (e.g. information flood, remote function controls) and developers (e.g. multi-platform development) that have to be addressed to guaranty the efficient development of usable, interactive systems for a safe human-machine interaction in such environments. In this article we present a model-based architecture for the design of context-sensitive mobile user interfaces that allow the abstract specification of an run-time adaptive user interface. Based on the model-based architecture, a prototypical implementation of a model interpreter -- the SmartMote -- and an industrial use case are presented that present the use of a run-time adaptive user interface and the feasibility of the presented approach.},

	Abstract = {Software is central to aircraft flight operation, and by the same token it is playing an increasing role in aircraft incidents and accidents. Software related errors have distinctive failure mechanisms, and their contributions to aircraft accident sequences are not properly understood or captured by traditional risk analysis techniques. To better understand these mechanisms, we analyze in this work five recent aircraft accidents and incidents involving software. For each case, we identify the role of software and analyze its contributions to the sequence of events leading to the accident. We adopt a visualization tool based on the Sequential Timed Event Plotting (STEP) methodology to highlight the software's interaction with sensors and other aircraft subsystems, and its contributions to the incident/accident. The case studies enable an in-depth analysis of recurrent failure mechanisms and provide insight into the causal chain and patterns through which software contributes to adverse events. For example, the case studies illustrate how software related failures can be context- or situation-dependent, situations that may have been overlooked during software verification and validation or testing. The case studies also identify the critical role of flawed sensor inputs as a key determinant or trigger of ``dormant'' software defects. In some cases, we find that software features put in place to address certain risks under nominal operating conditions are the ones that lead or contribute to accidents under off-nominal or unconsidered conditions. The case studies also demonstrate that the software may be complying with its requirements but still place the aircraft in a hazardous state or contribute to an adverse event. This result challenges the traditional notion, articulated in most standards, of software failure as non-compliance with requirements, and it invites a careful re-thinking of this and related concepts. We provide a careful review of these terms (software error, fault, failure), propose a synthesis of recurrent patterns of software contributions to adverse events and their triggering mechanisms, and conclude with some preliminary recommendations for tackling them.},

	Abstract = {While software simulations in the building technology field are essential for designing efficient systems, for specific applications, the tools currently available are computationally too expensive. This paper presents a novel approach for the fast computation of accurate simulation results and demonstrates its efficacy for solving a multiobjective optimization problem. A surrogate modeling approach is proposed, which is based on an effective interpolation algorithm and an optimal distribution of sampling nodes. The highest accuracy is shown to be achieved by a Poisson disk node distribution and an interpolation function developed from a cubic radial basis function. Furthermore, since global interpolation algorithms in high-dimensional spaces are fundamentally inefficient, a local adaptation is developed. The fidelity of the surrogate model is shown to generalize to higher dimensions with respect to the average number of nodes per dimension ηs. The application potential is tested on a case study consisting of a multiobjective design optimization problem. The results show that the surrogate and the fine model converge to the same solution. Being 150 times faster than the original model, the surrogate model is thus a valid choice for computationally demanding applications.},

Ubiquitous Computing, a vision of invisible computing integrated in our everyday surroundings, first introduced by M. Weiser and his group at Xerox PARC in 1988, is still in its early infancy and far from leaving the laboratory stage. Nevertheless there are foreseeable applications in specific areas like automotive automation, health care, home automation, advanced manufacturing. Some aspects of Ubiquitous Computing from an automatic control perspective and its relation to mixed reality, augmented reality and pervasive computing will be covered. Several problems like geometric representation, extensible computing, scalability, movable interactions, integration of various network-technologies, user interface design for multi-modality, design methodologies and evaluation techniques, security/privacy issues and enabling software concepts are touched and it will be speculated about how Ubiquitous Computing might influence Low Cost Advanced Manufacturing and how experiences from the automation and control field might influence the emerging community.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses the potential advantages and pitfalls of using semantic web technologies for representing and integrating modeling and analysis tools. Analytical tools are often not designed to be integrated with information sources and general-purpose modeling tools, and often do not support detection of problems across domains. Additionally, these modeling tools may not capture and represent explicitly the information needed to leverage the capabilities of analysis tools. The method described uses semantic web technology as the integrating mechanism between domain specific modeling (DSM) tools and analytical tools. We describe a method and tool set for representing the analytical knowledge through semantic web ontologies that map between the metamodels of both the DSM and analytical tools. We compare an earlier tool-chain prototype with a significantly revised prototype to reflect on the benefits from using semantic web technologies as an integrating mechanism. A potential advantage is the ability to represent the relationships between modeling and analytical tools explicitly and transparently.},

Identification and modeling of typical CPM types in a CPM library provides a first step towards enabling reuse of constructed and verified CPMs and, thus, a knowledge base making automatic composition of CPS out of CPMs possible.

However, this automation may be annoying since some tasks may grab users attention in inappropriate situations. Since user attention is a valuable resource, task automation must behave in a considerate manner demanding user attention only when it is required. To address this issue, this work presents a systematic method for supporting the design and automation of unobtrusive routine tasks that can adjust their obtrusiveness level at runtime according to the user attentional resources and context. This method proposes to design the routine tasks that the system must carry out and how they must interact with users in terms of obtrusiveness. The method also provides a software infrastructure that makes the execution of the tasks at the appropriate obtrusiveness degree a reality. Finally, the system has been validated by means of usefulness and performance tests and a practical case study that demonstrates the correctness and applicability of our approach without compromising system performance.},

The accuracy of the speech recognition system was estimated as ranging from approximately 60% to up to 97%, dependent on the speaker. The speech-controlled system latency was measured as well as the latency when the control is provided via touch on a so-called smart device. Measured latencies ranged from 0.4 s to 1.3 s. The platform was also clinically tested, providing promising results of cloud-based speech recognition for further implementation.

	Abstract = {Malfunctioning of distance relay third zone has been identified as one of the leading factors of power system blackouts in several nations. This inconsistency in operation happens when heavy loads start encroaching the zone 3 settings. In this paper, a novel multi-agent system based methodology for power system protection coordination is proposed. Various system agents are designed to collaborate and adaptively modify the setting of distance relay zone 3 via communication with neighboring substations. The proposed coordination scheme aids in preventing fault misjudgment and possible network breakdown because of load encroachment. Furthermore, it enhances the relay selectivity and loadability. It has been tested using MATLAB{\textregistered}/Simulink{\texttrademark} with the agent programming in Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE) platform. Analysis and test results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates distance relay malfunction under load encroachment.},

	Abstract = {The design process of mechatronic devices, which involves experts from different disciplines working together, has limited time and resource constraints. These experts normally have their own domain-specific designing methods and tools, which can lead to incompatibilities when one needs to work together using these those methods and tools. Having a proper framework which integrates different design tools is of interest, as such a framework can prevent incompatibilities between parts during the design process. In this paper, we propose our co-modelling methodology and co-simulation tools integration framework, which helps to maintain the domain specific properties of the model components during the co-design process of various mechatronic devices. To avoid expensive rework later in the design phase and even possible system failure, fault modelling and a layered structure with fault-tolerance mechanisms for the controller software are introduced. In the end, a practical mechatronic device is discussed to illustrate the methods and tools which are presented in this paper in details.},

	Abstract = {Nowadays home automation, with its increased availability, reliability and with its ever reducing costs is gaining momentum and is starting to become a viable solution for enabling people with disabilities to autonomously interact with their homes and to better communicate with other people. However, especially for people with severe mobility impairments, there is still a lack of tools and interfaces for effective control and interaction with home automation systems, and general--purpose solutions are seldom applicable due to the complexity, asynchronicity, time dependent behavior, and safety concerns typical of the home environment. This paper focuses on user--environment interfaces based on the eye tracking technology, which often is the only viable interaction modality for users as such. We propose an eye-based interface tackling the specific requirements of smart environments, already outlined in a public Recommendation issued by the COGAIN European Network of Excellence. The proposed interface has been implemented as a software prototype based on the ETU universal driver, thus being potentially able to run on a variety of eye trackers, and it is compatible with a wide set of smart home technologies, handled by the Domotic OSGi Gateway. A first interface evaluation, with user testing sessions, has been carried and results show that the interface is quite effective and usable without discomfort by people with almost regular eye movement control.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a novel ambient intelligence (AmI) platform is proposed to facilitate fast integration of different control algorithms, device networks and user interfaces. This platform defines the overall hardware/software architecture and communication standards. It consists of four layers, namely the ubiquitous environment, middleware, multi-agent system and application layer. The multi-agent system is implemented using Java Agent DEvelopment (JADE) framework and allows users to incorporate multiple control algorithms as agents for managing different tasks. The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) device discovery protocol is used as a middleware, which isolates the multi-agent system and physical ubiquitous environment while providing a standard communication channel between the two. An XML content language has been designed to provide standard communication between various user interfaces and the multi-agent system. A mobile ubiquitous setup box is designed to allow fast construction of ubiquitous environments in any physical space. The real time performance analysis shows the potential of the proposed AmI platform to be used in real-life AmI applications. A case study has also been carried out to demonstrate the possibility of integrating multiple control algorithms in the multi-agent system and achieving a significant improvement on the overall offline learning performance.},

Our software tool SAHRA integrates STPA in an existing engineering toolchain by providing an extension for the UML/SysML modeling tool Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect. We found that the qualification of this tool according to the mentioned safety standards was not straightforward and required further analysis. Therefore, we analyzed the tool risks and found that those depend on many factors such as process risks, risks from tool errors, tool integration risks and operational scenarios regarding the use of the tool in the development lifecycle. We selected four operational scenarios for tools supporting STPA to evaluate tool qualification requirements. After concluding that a tool qualification is required, we used a multi-domain tool qualification development lifecycle guided by DO-330 for SAHRA.},

Cost and schedule of producing large systems are increasing at an unsustainable rate and these systems often do not perform as intended. New systems are required that may not be achieved by current methods. To solve these problems, NASA is working to infuse concepts from Complexity Science into the engineering process. Some of these problems may be solved by a change in design philosophy. Instead of designing systems to meet known requirements that will always lead to fragile systems at some degree, systems should be designed wherever possible to be antifragile: designing cognitive cyber-physical systems that can learn from their experience, adapt to unforeseen events they face in their environment, and grow stronger in the face of adversity.

Thus it is being widely used as a test tool for software products requiring high reliability such as mission critical cyber-physical systems. However, existing virtualization platforms do not fully virtualize the battery subsystem. Therefore, it is difficult to test battery-related features of guest systems. In this paper, we propose Virtual Battery, a battery virtualization scheme for type II full virtualization platforms. Virtual Battery takes the form of an ACPI-compatible battery device driver dedicated to each virtual machine, which virtualizes a target system. Through Virtual Battery, developers can easily manipulate the charging and battery status of each virtual machine (VM), regardless of the existence or current status of the host system's battery. In addition, Virtual Battery emulates the behavior of batteries by discharging the virtual batteries according to the resource usages of their VMs. This feature enables VMs to act as battery resource containers. Three case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

However, time-consuming and labor-intensive works hamper the development of smart building applications. Therefore, application developers need the proper software platforms to efficiently design the applications. Much research currently proposed the design approaches based on low-level concerns and the real-world deployments based on high-level programming abstraction are rare. Accordingly, the pressing issue is how to offer the easy-to-use tools with acceptable performance to rapidly and easily design the application scenarios for non-technical application users. Therefore, this study focuses on the application-layer simulation to propose a Visualization System of Context-aware Application Scenario Planning (VS-CaSP) for assisting non-technical developers and end-users in rapidly and easily designing the application scenario of smart buildings and in performing the acceptable and predictable simulation and evaluation. VS-CaSp applies rule-based and 3D visualization techniques to offer a 3D authoring environment integrated with real Zigbee sensor devices, where designers are able to rapidly construct immersive 3D buildings and easily plan the context-aware application scenario via GUI tool based on proposed three-tier rule hierarchy, to visually simulate and verify the planned scenario via virtual and real sensor devices, and to repeatedly modify the control strategies to enhance the deployment effectiveness. The experimental results show that VS-CaSP is easy to use for the support of quickly designing smart building applications, but not professional enough for developments of 3D modeling, animation, and rule expression. Accordingly, it is workable and expected to prove beneficial to non-technical users.},

However, very few of these accomplishments have focused on the design of intelligent systems which would allow nonexperts to model and to adapt a home automation environment for the disabled. This design work is currently restricted to technicians, rather than occupational therapists or others who are able to best understand the needs of those with mobility or cognitive impairments. To take up these challenges, this paper proposes a design flow including a component approach for modeling system architecture and a range of services to meet the needs of both developers and users.

Automotive control system is a typical CPS example and often designed based on a time-triggered paradigm. In this paper, a co-simulation framework that considers interacting CPS components for assisting time-triggered automotive CPS design is proposed. Virtual prototyping of automotive vehicles is the core of this framework, which uses SystemC to model the cyber components and integrates CarSim to model the vehicle dynamics. A network/platform model in SystemC forms the backbone of the virtual prototyping. The network/platform model consists of processing elements abstracted by real-time operating systems, communication systems, sensors, and actuators. The framework is also integrated with a model-based design tool to enable rapid prototyping. The framework is validated by comparing simulation results with the results from a hardware-in-the-loop automotive simulator. The framework is also used for design space exploration (DSE).},

	Abstract = {Within agent-based Ambient Intelligence applications agents react to humans based on information obtained by sensoring and their knowledge about human functioning. Appropriate types of reactions depend on the extent to which an agent understands the human and is able to interpret the available information (which is often incomplete, and hence multi-interpretable) in order to create a more complete internal image of the environment, including humans. Such an understanding requires that the agent has knowledge to a certain depth about the human's physiological and mental processes in the form of an explicitly represented model of the causal and dynamic relations describing these processes. In addition, given such a model representation, the agent needs reasoning methods to derive conclusions from the model and interpret the (partial) information available by sensoring. This paper presents the development of a toolbox that can be used by a modeller to design Ambient Intelligence applications. This toolbox contains a number of model-based reasoning methods and approaches to control such reasoning methods. Formal specifications in an executable temporal format are offered, which allows for simulation of reasoning processes and automated verification of the resulting reasoning traces in a dedicated software environment. A number of such simulation experiments and their formal analysis are described. The main contribution of this paper is that the reasoning methods in the toolbox have the possibility to reason using both quantitative and qualitative aspects in combination with a temporal dimension, and the possibility to perform focused reasoning based upon certain heuristic information.},

Due to the temporal dependency in quality of measured data, such Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) commonly have real-time requirements on communication. In addition, these systems shall become more flexible and scalable, e.g., by adding new components to the CPS. This would be most suitable if a CPS could react to the presence of a new component and reconfigure itself to run afterwards with the new component integrated to the CPS. This capability is covered by the term Plug-and-Produce. In this paper, we propose a concept to enable Plug-and-Produce within a CPS whose network uses different communication media, e.g., Ethernet and CAN. In this context, we also introduce our three layered software architecture that supports the proposed concept for self-reconfiguration.},

	Abstract = {Increasing competitive pressure within industries producing long-living, cost intensive products drive the need to optimize product life cycles in terms of faster time to market, sustainable operation, reengineering and recycling. In this context, complexity of IT systems is growing and has to connect different life cycle phases. Especially new concepts of Product Service Systems (PSS) lead to a connection between product design, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO). There are still many challenges concerning interface problems between different IT-Systems. They are caused by different data formats, continuous demand for information or integration of new technologies. Thus, Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) has gained an important role and needs to consider integration of new industry 4.0 solutions like cloud services, big data or cyber physical systems. This paper gives an overview about these challenges, future development and new research approaches. A deeper view is taken at one promising approach in the field of maintenance of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). This approach is about invention and implementation of a new process that combines both electrical and optical measuring techniques to automate circuit and layout plan reconstruction of long-living and cost intensive electronic boards.},

In the model, the main stream of information goes from the biophysical world of patients at home to the socio-medical world of carers through a chain of devices including in-home sensors, local area network, home computer, remote server, and carers' computers. Each device hosts software agents with different levels of knowledge and complexity. Internet and Java technologies provide the building blocks of the designed telemonitoring software. Laboratory experiments have been realized using a fully equipped `smart' demonstration home for telecare.

It is the expectation that adapting smart home automation (SHA) would lead to reduced electricity usage in the household and overall environmental advantages. The purpose of this research was to quantify the negative environmental impacts of SHA and balance them with their benefits. The evaluation of SHA has been done by conducting a generic Life cycle assessment study using SimaPro programme and the EcoInvent database. The LCA study concluded that the largest environmental impact of HEMS is the use-phase electricity consumption of home automation devices. The paper concludes that the energy payback time of home automation in term of the electricity consumption of the devices is negative by 1.6 years. The largest part of this is due to the energy consumption of smart plugs. Therefore, the paper concludes that in terms of home automation, we need to find the balance between what we actually need to control and the resulting energy consumption of the control system.},

	Abstract = {This work presents a Web Service Middleware infrastructure for Ambient Intelligence environments, named aWESoME. aWESoME is a vital part of the Smart IHU project, a large-scale Smart University deployment. The purpose of the proposed middleware within the project is twofold: for one, to ensure universal, homogeneous access to the system's functions and secondly, to fulfill functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Namely, the infrastructure itself should consume significantly low power (as it is meant for energy savings in addition to automations), without compromising reliability and fast response time. The infrastructure should enable fast and direct discovery, invocation and execution of services. Finally, on hardware level, the wireless sensor and actuator network should be optimally configured for speed and reliability as well. The proposed solution employs widely used web open standards for description and discovery to expose hardware and software functions and ensure interoperability, even outside the borders of this university deployment. It proposes a straightforward method to integrate low-cost and resource-constrained heterogeneous devices found in the market and a large-scale placement of servers and wireless sensor networks. Different server hardware installations have been evaluated to find the optimum trade-off between response time and power consumption. Finally, a range of client applications that exploit the middleware on different platforms are demonstrated, to prove its usability and effectiveness in enabling, in this scenario, energy monitoring and savings.},

	Abstract = {As the number of smart meters/sensors increases to more than hundreds of thousands, it is rather intuitive that the state-of-the-art centralized information processing architecture will no longer be sustainable under such a big data explosion. Hence, an innovative data management system is urgently needed to facilitate the real-world deployment of a future residential distribution system. In this paper, we investigate a radically different approach through distributed software agents to translate the legacy centralized data storage and processing scheme to a completely distributed cyber-physical architecture. We further substantiate the proposed distributed data storage and processing framework on a proof-of-concept testbed using a cluster of low-cost and credit-card-sized single-board computers. Finally, we evaluate the proposed distributed framework and proof-of-concept testbed with a comprehensive set of performance measures.},

This paper proposes an incremental approach to building context-aware pervasive systems, with a particular emphasis on systematically extending over time the contexts and situations a system can be aware of, and creating a formalism in which these systems can be composed. We present a formalism of operators for building context-aware pervasive systems incrementally and in a compositional manner (by combining multiple systems and subsystems), facilitating reuse in a formal way. The formalism can serve as: (i) a basis for a scripting language for programming composite systems, and (ii) a language for specifying these systems (whether existing or to be built) and then reasoning with specifications of these systems.},

Currently, much effort is put in counteracting this development by making appliances more energy efficient. However, a still widely neglected potential for energy savings resides in the use, control and interaction of facilities. To reach their full efficiency during operation, a comprehensive software system that orchestrates all energy facilities in the home is needed. Such a solution also provides an integration point for decentralized energy production systems and smart grid applications. To operate successfully, the system has to be aware of a multitude of different energy parameters and facilities as well as providers in order to make energy efficient decisions on behalf of the user, thus aiding in the realization of an eco-friendly operation of the smart home. In this work, such a smart home knowledge base is realized following the Web Ontology Language (OWL) standard. Its structure makes all knowledge easily available to the smart home system and considerably supports the control processes with its inherent logic.},

In this work, we propose and validate a universal connector framework that allows, through a web service interface using cloud technologies, diverse software components and mobile devices communicate with each other. For example, components and devices in pervasive systems can exchange context information, and analyze them to deduce new rules. As a proof of concept, we apply this connector in a mobile messenger context and shows our results.},

Therefore, adapting QA systems to new restricted domains is an increasingly necessity for these systems to be applied in AmI environments. Unfortunately, research addressing adaptation of QA systems to new domains has two main drawbacks: (i) QA systems are manually tuned, which requires a huge effort in time and cost, and (ii) tuning of QA systems depends on the specific representation scheme of the restricted-domain knowledge, thus hinders incorporation of new resources into the system. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a novel approach based on model-driven development in order to seamlessly integrate textual information and knowledge resources to automatically and effortlessly adapt QA systems to be useful for restricted-domain AmI environments, such as e-Science.},

	Abstract = {High profile systemic safety standards for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) development within the transportation domain have commonalities with regard to their view of the safety-related implications of tool usage. Their guidelines on tool qualification favor a bottom-up approach in which tools are dealt with in isolation and mostly if they may directly introduce faults into end products. This guidance may ignore risk introduced by the integration of software tools, especially if these risks are related to low levels of automation -- such as process notifications and improper graphical user interfaces. This paper presents a study that ties weaknesses in support environments to software faults. Based on the observed weaknesses guidelines for a top-down software tool chain qualification are suggested for inclusion in the next generation of safety standards. This has implications not only for the surveyed standards in the transportation domain, but also for other standards for safety--critical CPS development that do not include a broader view on risks related to tool usage. Furthermore, given the type of omission identified in the surveyed standards, it is suggested that researchers interested in the safety-related implications of tool integration should approach organizational research in search of possibilities to set up theory triangulation studies.},

In addition, the use of context-aware technologies is an essential aspect in these developments in order to perceive stimuli from the context and react to it autonomously. This paper presents the integration of the Hardware-Embedded Reactive Agents (HERA) Platform into the Flexible and User Services Oriented Multi-agent Architecture (FUSION@), a multi-agent architecture for developing AmI systems that integrates intelligent agents with a service-oriented architecture approach. Because of this integration, FUSION@ has the ability to manage both software and hardware agents by using self-adaptable heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. Preliminary results presented in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of FUSION@ as a future alternative for developing Ambient Intelligence systems where users and systems can use both software and hardware agents in a transparent way, achieving a higher level of ubiquitous computing and communication.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses a research project to support virtual design and verification of industrial process plant designs. Process plants are a class of cyber-physical systems (CPS), and these research results should generally apply to other types of CPS such as those associated with the Smart Grid. Modeling is an essential part of process plant design and integral in other applications such as manufacturing. Models produced in design have obvious roles in system implementation, deployment and certification. For manufacturing systems, models also have use in downstream activities including system certification, performance optimization, real-time diagnostics and prognostics, and maintenance. The paper discusses the results associated with a prototype that uses domain-specific models of different views of a system design that improves collaboration through integrated models and aligned semantics and provides examples of how the integration with formal methods can identify defects in designs, and automatically generate test vectors with requirement-to-test traceability.},

The framework allows engineers to equip the management system with standardized interfaces, which will significantly increase re-usability of newly developed and legacy models. Furthermore, the overall CPSoS model, including the communication architecture, is generated automatically, making tedious manual implementation superfluous while reducing the potential of modeling errors, and the standardized, generic interfaces to which model components must connect to will provide a straightforward avenue for the deployment of management solutions to industrial hardware systems.},

	Abstract = {Several researchers have identified the need to count on presence awareness in ubiquitous systems that support mobile activities, particularly when these systems are used to perform loosely-coupled mobile work. In such a work style, mobile users conduct face-to-face on-demand interactions, therefore counting on awareness information about the position and availability of potential collaborators becomes mandatory for these applications. Most proposed solutions that provide user presence awareness involve centralized components, have reusability limitations, or simply address a part of that service. This article presents a lightweight and fully distributed middleware named Moware, which allows developers to embed presence awareness services in mobile ubiquitous systems in a simple way. The article also describes the Moware architecture, its main components and strategies used to deal with several aspects of the presence awareness support. These design strategies can be reused by software designers to provide presence awareness capabilities into middleware and specific software applications. Moware services were embedded in a mobile ubiquitous system that supports inspectors during the construction inspection process. The preliminary results indicate that the middleware was easy to use for developers, and its services were useful for the end-users.},

	Abstract = {Ambient intelligence (AmI) worlds consist of heterogeneous collections of interconnected devices that integrate smoothly in the environment to offer services to their users. These devices can be added, change or fail, modifying the system topology. Also, other circumstances may change, affecting users' activities, e.g., time, location, or the presence of other users. These changes modify the information the system has available to satisfy users' needs, i.e., the context. AmI systems need to adapt to these evolving conditions in order to be able to provide their services, but being as unobtrusive as possible for their users. There are also performance requirements that the system must fulfill to provide responses to environment stimuli in real time. Opportunistic control mechanisms address these issues by monitoring the context, and suspending or resolving goals when the appropriate conditions are met. This paper presents FAERIE, a software framework that supports the development of AmI applications with facilities for context management that rely on opportunistic control. The development of FAERIE systems uses a 3D simulator tool for testing and validation called UbikSim. A case study on an artistic installation illustrates the use of this infrastructure.},

They should not be conscious of how these features are implemented, from a hardware or from a software point of view. In order to obtain such a high degree of transparency, it is necessary for the system to be able to provide its services regardless of location, adapting to the environment and the context in general and to the available hardware more specifically. This is known as ubiquity, and to achieve it requires considering many aspects, from security and privacy to system interoperability. This paper is mainly focused on the development of two elements related to ubiquity: physical migration of components between different platforms together with their associated runtime state, and the adaptation of those components to the destination platform and physical environment.

	Abstract = {Engineering approaches to product development in the aerospace and defense industries still engender aspects of board-based design and prototype development. Cultural inertia pushes back on the reality that products need to be rapidly developed and produced at lower costs in order to be competitive. Aircraft manufacturers have had some success using model-based design and computer simulations to eliminate prototyping, but cyber physical weapon development is still highly dependent on past engineering experience and the development of working prototypes. This paper discusses how a model-based, information-centric environment can accelerate the design of new systems. Central to this paradigm shift is the introduction of information models to complement product models. The overall goal of information-centric product development is the reduction of the traditional engineering semi-sequential process and an over-reliance on extremely precise requirements and risk mediation. In the new model, all engineering and manufacturing processes are represented as simultaneous, asynchronous events which constitute a very complex and dynamic environment.},

	Abstract = {Recently, the cyber physical system has emerged as a promising direction to enrich the interactions between physical and virtual worlds. Meanwhile, a lot of research is dedicated to wireless sensor networks as an integral part of cyber physical systems. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network consisting of spatially distributed autonomous devices that use sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions. These autonomous devices, or nodes, combine with routers and a gateway to create a typical WSN system. Shrinking size and increasing deployment density of wireless sensor nodes implies the smaller equipped battery size. This means emerging wireless sensor nodes must compete for efficient energy utilization to increase the WSN lifetime. The network lifetime is defined as the time duration until the first sensor node in a network fails due to battery depletion. One solution for enhancing the lifetime of WSN is to utilize mobile agents. In this paper, we propose an agent-based approach that performs data processing and data aggregation decisions locally i.e., at nodes rather than bringing data back to a central processor (sink). Our proposed approach increases the network lifetime by generating an optimal routing path for mobile agents to transverse the network. The proposed approach consists of two phases. In the first phase, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to generate a complete graph to connect all source nodes in a WSN. In the second phase, a genetic algorithm is used to generate the best-approximated route for mobile agents in a radio harsh environment to route the sensory data to the base-station. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, a formal analysis and experimental results are presented.},

	Abstract = {The traditional way of engineering production systems requires static information flows within and in between automation software, from field control software to manufacturing operations management. The common understanding of data and its containing information is realized by implicit assumptions on data semantics. In contrast, the vision of future production systems as cyber-physical systems (CPS) focuses on intelligent production facilities, which are characterized by autonomous behavior and dynamic, cooperative interactions. As a consequence, data and information that are stored and exchanged within CPS cannot rely on the assumption that other software systems are aware of data semantics. A means to solve this issue is ontologies -- an approach being intensely discussed and applied for enhancing data with semantics. However, reuse of ontologies within the automation domain is hampered as ontologies are developed for specific use cases without having reusability in mind. In this paper, these drawbacks of ontology development are discussed and an approach for maximizing reusability through modularizing ontologies for different fields of the automation domain is presented.},

	Abstract = {Numerous smart home systems have been created in the recent years, but they still lack of high interoperability and research has been focused on single smart technologies instead of the system interoperability as a whole. Furthermore, available systems are usually strongly technology-oriented and they neglect the user's satisfaction and the benefits' analysis. In addition to this, modern systems impose the intelligent management of a huger amount of data, which needs to be properly coordinated to achieve higher performances and offer new energy-control services. This paper defines an information management model to improve device interoperability in smart homes. It allows selecting and classifying the devices, visualizing their data model, aggregating the necessary data according to the desired service functions, and finally defining a set of rules to coordinate device operations according to user preferences and external events. A case study focused on washing machines is presented to demonstrate the methodology implementation; it allows designing and developing an energy-control service for the selected device and optimizing its functions according to the users' needs and preferences as well as the constraints of the use scenario. Finally, the benefits achieved with such a new service are evaluated in terms of energy consumption, costs reduction and user satisfaction in a simulated home environment that represents practical scenarios of use.},

The implementation of complex digital control techniques, like MPC, is becoming increasingly adopted in embedded systems, where reduced precision computation techniques are embraced to achieve fast execution and low power consumption. However, in a low precision implementation, constraint satisfaction is not guaranteed if infinite precision is assumed during the algorithm design. To enforce constraint satisfaction under numerical errors, we use forward error analysis to compute an error bound on the output of the embedded controller. We treat this error as a state disturbance and use this to inform the design of a constraint-tightening robust controller. Benchmarks with a classical control problem, namely an inverted pendulum, show how it is possible to guarantee, by design, constraint satisfaction for embedded systems featuring low precision, fixed-point computations.},

Smart home (or industrial) environments include automation and control devices to save energy, perform tasks, assist and give comfort in order to satisfy specific preferences. This paper focuses on the proposal for Software Reference Architecture for the development of smart applications and their deployment in smart environments. The motivation for this Reference Architecture and its benefits are also explained. The proposal considers three main processes in the software architecture of these applications: perception, reasoning and acting. This paper centres attention on the definition of the Perception process and provides an example for its implementation and subsequent validation of the proposal. The software presented implements the Perception process of a smart environment for a standard office, by retrieving data from the real world and storing it for further reasoning and acting processes. The objectives of this solution include the provision of comfort for the users and the saving of energy in lighting. Through this verification, it is also shown that developments under this proposal produce major benefits within the software life cycle.},

The latter may facilitate research on CPS from a business-oriented and a customer value creation perspective rather than solely from a technical perspective.

Currently no general frameworks are available to bridge the concept-code gap rampant in design and development of complex, software-intensive mechatronic systems called cyber-physical systems. To fill this gap and provide an alternative approach to Object Management Group's UML/SysML/OCL combination, we propose: Bond Graph based Unified Meta-Modeling Framework (BG-UMF). BG-UMF is a practical and viable alternative and uses a novel hybrid approach based on model unification and integration. The focus is on conceptual design and development of executable models for large systems. The viability of the framework is demonstrated through an application scenario: conceptual design and development of a navigation and control system for a rotor-craft UAV.},

	Abstract = {Industrial automation systems (IASs) are commonly developed using the languages defined by the IEC 61131 standard and are executed on programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Their software part is commonly considered only after the development and integration of mechanics and electronics. However, this approach narrows the solution space for software; thus, it is considered inadequate to address the complexity of today's systems. In this paper, we adopt a system-based approach for the development of IASs. Based on this, the UML model of the software part of the system is extracted from the SysML system model and it is then refined to get the implementation code. Two implementation alternatives are considered to exploit both PLCs and the recent deluge of embedded boards in the market. For PLC targets, the new version of IEC 61131 that supports object-orientation is adopted, while Java is used for embedded boards. The case study used to illustrate our approach was developed as a lab exercise, which aims to introduce to students a number of technologies used to address challenges in the domain of cyber--physical systems and highlights the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) as a glue for their cyber interfaces.},

This class of problems is defined by a tight integration of software and physical processes, the need to satisfy stringent constraints on performance, safety and a reliance on automation for the management of system functionality. To assure correctness of functionality with respect to requirements, there is a strong need for methods of analysis that can describe system behavior in terms of time, intervals of time, and relationships among intervals of time. Accordingly, this paper discusses temporal semantics and their central role in the development of a new time-based reasoning framework in MBSE for CPS. Three independent but integrated modules compose the system: CPS, ontology and time-reasoning modules. This approach is shown to be mostly appropriate for CPS for which safety and performance are dependent on the correct time- based prediction of the future state of the system. A Python-based prototype implementation has been created to demonstrate the capabilities of the ontological framework and reasoning engine in simple CPS applications.},

Businesses can benefit from the integration of these real-world data; new services can be provided to customers, or existing business processes can be improved. Events are a well-known concept in business processes. However, there is no appropriate abstraction mechanism to encapsulate event stream processing in units that represent business functions in a coherent manner across the process modeling, process execution, and IT infrastructure layer. In this paper we present Event Stream Processing Units (SPUs) as such an abstraction mechanism. SPUs encapsulate application logic for event stream processing and enable a seamless transition between process models, executable process representations, and components at the IT layer. We derive requirements for SPUs and introduce EPC and BPMN extensions to model SPUs at the abstract and at the technical process layer. We introduce a transformation from SPUs in EPCs to SPUs in BPMN and implement our modeling notation extensions in Software AG ARIS. We present a runtime infrastructure that executes SPUs and supports implicit invocation and completion semantics. We illustrate our approach using a logistics process as running example.},

	Abstract = {The cost of state-of-the-art devices and robots is critical for the uptake of Ambient Intelligence (AmI). One way to utilize low-cost hardware for both devices and robots is to run smart software remotely as agents deployed on computationally rich environments. In this context, the devices and the robots can be seen as the Avatars of agents, while the way devices and agents are related may be considered as an Ambient Ecology. We show how the application of a middleware platform called EVATAR realizes this vision by exemplifying the main issues with a multi-robot and a smart-home scenarios.},

	Abstract = {The Ambient Intelligence (AmI) paradigm envisions systems whose central entity is the user. AmI integrates technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, implicit Human Computer Interaction, and Ubiquitous Services. Each capability of AmI systems is oriented towards assistance of humans at work, in the classroom, or even at home. In consequence, the AmI development process usually incorporates the final user since the first stages. However, having users available during all this long process is not always possible. Agent-based social simulations where the users׳ role is played by simulated entities can be used to make the AmI development process faster and more effective. In this scenario, the modelling of CMHBs (Computational Models of Human Behaviour) is a major challenge. To address this issue, this paper proposes a methodology whose main contributions are: (1) the use of domain experts׳ knowledge to create CMHBs; (2) a common methodological framework to develop CMHBs by combining information obtained from sensors׳ perceptions and experts׳ experiences; and, (3) open source tools to support this development paradigm. The paper also presents a full case of study in a hospital which illustrates: the number of recommendations made by the methodology; the techniques proposed (mainly the use of ontologies and temporal reasoning); and, the potential of the methodology to model the personnel in a hospital.},

	Abstract = {Development of several computing and communication technologies is enabling the widespread availability of pervasive systems. In smart home applications, household appliances---such as security alarms, heating systems, doors and windows---are connected to home digital networks. These applications offer features that are typically developed by disparate vendors, and when composed together, these features are expected to work together harmoniously. Engineering these systems poses two main challenges. The first challenge is: how can developers of individual features specify the features in order to make them composable with other hitherto unknown features? The second challenge is: when composition of features does not produce the desired behaviour, what can be done to resolve this non-intrusively? This article argues that the two issues are intrinsically related, and proposes an approach that addresses the first challenge in a way that makes the second challenge manageable. In particular, we describe a way of writing feature specifications in which assumptions about the problem world are made explicit. These feature assumptions can then be evaluated at runtime in order to preserve the desired system behaviour to the extent possible. Our approach is illustrated with examples from smart home applications.},

The buildings are supposed to be smart; they are connected to the electric network but they are also equipped with PV plants for integration of the electric energy request with the relevant storage batteries. The idea behind is to use batteries of electric vehicles (present in the parking areas of the buildings) as supplementary storage systems. An algorithm is discussed, based on optimization techniques, that allows maximizing the number of electric appliances that can be fed in conditions of power limitation. The algorithm is purely numeric, and has been built with the idea to implement it in a software package that has been produced by the authors. Finally, a case study is presented which allows evaluating the reliability and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and of the software.},

	Abstract = {Ambient intelligence, ubiquitous and networked robots, and cloud robotics are new research hot topics that have started to gain popularity among the robotics community. They enable robots to acquire richer functionalities and open the way for the composition of a variety of robotic services with three functions: semantic perception, reasoning and actuation. Ubiquitous robots (ubirobots) overcome the limitations of stand-alone robots by integrating them with web services and ambient intelligence technologies. The overlap that exists now between ubirobots and ambient intelligence makes their integration worthwhile. It targets to create a hybrid physical--digital space rich with a myriad of proactive intelligent services that enhance the quality and the way of our living and working. Furthermore, the emergence of cloud computing initiates the massive use of a new generation of ubirobots that enrich their cognitive capabilities and share their knowledge by connecting themselves to cloud infrastructures. The future of ubirobots will certainly be open to an unlimited space of applications such as physical and virtual companions assisting people in their daily living, ubirobots that are able to co-work alongside people and cooperate with them in the same environment, and physical and virtual autonomic guards that are able to protect people, monitor their security and safety, and rescue them in indoor and outdoor spaces. This paper introduces the recent challenges and future trends on these topics.},

The convergence at the network-technology level was achieved by using the Internet protocol (IP), and therefore both integrated systems have to provide IP connectivity. To enable communication between the HASS and the IP-based services, we have implemented the WebService/Konnex gateway. The IPTVSS are IP based; therefore, an easy convergence at the network-technology level is possible. The convergence at the user-interface level was achieved by a hardware and software user-interface implementation.},

@article{LORA2015843,
	Abstract = {Several embedded system applications are used to control physical processes thus leading to the concept of Cyber-Physical System. Sensing, computation and actuation are combined by involving a set of highly heterogeneous components, i.e., digital and analog hardware, software, energy sources, and external physical systems (e.g., a room to be heated, a mechanical component). Moreover, we see the growing use of networks to connect several sub-systems in a more efficient way; this contributes to introduce a further level of heterogeneity due to the presence of messages exchanged over communication channels. All these aspects should be taken into account in the design process to find highly optimized solutions; in particular, simulation is a key technique for their verification. However, the heterogeneity of components, together with the presence of the network, forces to adopt complex and slow co-simulation techniques to carry on the simulation of the entire system. This work aims at proposing SystemC as unified framework to model and simulate Networked Cyber-Physical Systems. Concerning the modeling of continuous-time components and a specific class of discrete-time components, the different Models of Computation provided by the Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) extension of SystemC are used. Regarding the network, SystemC and the SystemC Network Simulation Library are used to model communications at different abstraction levels. The approach is validated by considering a networked control system. First, the accuracy and speed of SystemC simulation is compared to Matlab/Simulink simulation. Second, different simulation alternatives are compared to co-simulation. Finally, we show that the simulation speed-up achieved by all-SystemC modeling allows to explore several design alternatives and the accurate modeling of the communication network can improve the design of the controller.},

This paper concentrates on the second aspect, presenting some didactic activities that are interesting for both control and computer science/engineering students. After motivating the proposed pedagogy from a cultural point of view, also as a means to foster the necessary convergence of the two mentioned communities, some examples of activities are presented and discussed. The purpose is twofold. On one hand, the reader can see how many concepts -- ranging from control structures through cyber-physical systems to process/control co-design and more -- can be exemplified and experimented with, both in simulation and on real systems that virtually any student already possesses. On the other hand, and maybe most important, the usefulness of those concepts for the design -- not just the control -- of computing systems, can be appreciated, and constitutes a very promising research and engineering field. To this end, a brief sketch of future perspectives concludes the paper.},
