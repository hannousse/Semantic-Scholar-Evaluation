	Abstract = {Advances in computer gaming technology, digital game design, game engine development, mobile computing, and mobile software engineering, stimulated active research on gamification of processes and activities in "serious" areas such as education, learning, corporate training, management, administration, marketing, simulations of complex physical objects and phenomena, engineering, project management, Wellness, healthcare, chemistry, and other areas. The performed analysis of the current status of serious games' applications in industry clearly shows that it will soon need a significant number of well educated and highly skilled specialists in gamification of main business processes, including serious games' software engineers, analysts, designers, developers, testers, etc. The findings and outcomes of performed analysis motivated the authors - faculty and graduate student at Bradley University (Peoria, IL, U.S.A.) - to work collaboratively, propose a new approach and ways of gamification of software engineering curriculum.},

	Abstract = {This paper builds on work previously published as best paper at CSEDU 2013 [1], which describes the motivation gap between the teacher'sview ofstudent motivation and their actual motivation. As a result of this mismatch, the gamified Software Engineering course under observation [2], did not appeal to the students in the expected way. Our findings give rise to a number of design criteria for e-Learning and blended coursethat address the motivation gap in order to increase the numberstudentsthat are able to self-regulate their studies and stay or become motivated by the course as defined by Dan Pink's motivational factors: autonomy, mastery andpurpose [3].},

@article{Sheth:2013,
	Abstract = {Introductory Computer Science (CS) classes are typically competitive in nature. The cutthroat nature of these classes comes from students attempting to get as high a grade as possible, which may or may not correlate with actual learning. Further, there is very little collaboration allowed in most introductory CS classes. Most assignments are completed individually since many educators feel that students learn the most, especially in introductory classes, by working alone. In addition to completing ``normal'' individual assignments, which have many benefits, we wanted to expose students to collaboration early (via, for example, team projects). In this paper, we describe how we leveraged competition and collaboration in a CS2 class to help students learn aspects of computer science better - in this case, good software design and software testing - and summarize student feedback.},

For example, theories related to risk management. This work implements a proposal of a Gamified Web Application to strengthen the teaching of risk management. The building of the application focuses particularly on the stages of identification, analysis and mitigation of risks in technological projects. The findings of this study shows, through the use of decision tree, why Gamification is a suitable framework for the issues raised in comparison with other game based learning techniques. In addition to the theoretical contribution, the study provides an implementation of a web application, built according to Gamification Framework 6D. The application can be used to teach risk management and for future experimentation use to prove the effectiveness of Gamification in contrast to a traditional teaching method.},

@article{Mora:2016,
	Abstract = {Both engagement and motivation are important factors in any learning process. Fortunately, there are different approaches worth considering during the design process of learning experiences that could help educators create engagement. One that has shown great potential is the inclusion of game design principles, or game-like experiences, in a curriculum. This paper presents the design and analysis of an e-learning activity within a software engineering course that relies on the application of such an approach as its motivational foundation from a purely educational standpoint (i.e. not as entertainment). The goal was to encourage adult learners to solve non-graded formative activities and to increase their sense of kinship to the class group. After one semester, the results revealed a positive assessment of the experience designed and student engagement.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a case study of a gamified learning experience, designed with a guiding gamification framework, for a software engineering study group. The group was formed to evaluate the learning experience in a laboratory-like setting, and the results are intended to inform the design process. Grounded-theory procedures were used to analyze qualitative data about students' perceptions of the gamified experience. Students reported positive effects such as improved content comprehension, retention, and recap. They also highlighted a positive change in the study dynamics, especially due to the practical application of concepts, the game-like experience and a reduced amount of time for studying. The latter, however, was associated with a specific type of challenge proposed as part of the gamified structure. The other type of challenge, actually, made them face difficulties related to a lack of time. They also did not progress to higher levels of evolution proposed in the gamified structure. These are indicative of the need to improve the learning experience. These improvements, also discussed in this paper, will be evaluated in real settings in future work.},

@inproceedings{Kheirkhahzadeh:2016,
	Abstract = {The ability to provide and implement software solutions is a fundamental component of a computer scientist curriculum. Commonly referred to as the ability to program, this task involves the development of programs to address everyday problems. Over the last decade teaching practices have evolved alongside programming languages to facilitate the learning process. While abstracting the level of understanding has helped students with the fundamentals of software development, issues related to students' engagement and motivation are still not adequately addressed. With motivation being a vital component of the students' life cycle and at the basis of their engagement, the concept of software engineering introduced in the class needs to be revised and become more engaging so as to be practised thoroughly by the students.
To address these challenges, educators have devised numerous frameworks to allow students to hone their programming skills. The idea of embedding gaming aspects into the learning cycle has led to the development of techniques such as serious games and game-based learning, while more recent techniques have been unified under the term gamification. Several researchers have incorporated the gamification concept into computer science classes in order to improve students' engagement with the teaching material, with early evaluations confirming the effectiveness of this approach. The present study focuses on the use of a gamification platform to create stimulating content and increase motivation. Students were presented with a new gamification system designed to attract and hold their attention through a number of programming challenges in the form of a contest. The results of the experiment demonstrate the students' behavioural changes towards a deeper cognitive engagement. The paper then further discusses the challenges that have arisen in this new learning environment, such as demotivation of students with low contest rankings.
Teaching how to write good software has been part of an ongoing debate for the last decade. With student motivation being a central component, this paper discusses the use of a gamification environment to engage students with the teaching material and reinforce the concepts of software engineering introduced in class.},

The data collected and analysed included logs, questionnaires, and pre- and post-tests. The results of the evaluation show positive effects on the engagement of students toward the gamified learning activities and a moderate improvement in learning outcomes.

	Abstract = {Gamification is a new emerging technology in high level education to engage students into to non-game context in a horizon of four to five years. Cyber enabled learning environment provides a collaborative and sustainable platform for learners to continue studying context outside classroom and lecturing time. However, one of the challenges faced by cyber enabled virtual learning environment is student engagement and motivation. In this paper, we presented the study and results of improving student engagement and motivation by integrating design mechanisms of gamification to WReSTT-CyLE -- a high level software testing learning environment. The data collected and the experimental results of class studies were performed at Alabama A&M University in the past year in several sessions. A wide assessment of gamification for student engagement using WReSTT-CyLE tool was investigated and discussed in several categories. To demonstrate how to apply gamification technology to the student classes, a class design and revised syllabus with teaching modules were presented. WReSTT-CyLE is a highly integrated environment that synthesizes several key concepts including social media, collaborative learning, and learning objects to support student learning software testing concepts effectively and efficiently. From this experimental study, we have observed the support of student engagement from the social factors that were built in WReSTT-CyLE. In this paper, we focus on the design architecture of gamification, assessment, and analysis of effectiveness of WReSTT-CyLE based on our study results. Our study results has demonstrated a successful model and guideline for the educators and researchers to implement and synthesize gamification to the cyber enabled virtual learning environment in other STEM subjects.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we outline the idea to adopt gamification techniques to engage, train, monitor, and motivate all the players involved in the development of complex software artifacts, from the inception to the deployment and maintenance. The paper introduces the concept of gamification and proposes a research approach to understand how its principles may be successfully applied to the process of software development. Applying gamification to software engineering is not as straightforward as it may appear since it has to be casted to the peculiarities of this domain. Existing literature in the area has already recognized the possible use of such technology in the context of software development, however how to design and use gamification in this context is still an open question. This leads to several research challenges which are organized in a fascinating research agenda that is part of the contribution of this paper. Finally, to support the proposed ideas we present a preliminary experiment that shows the effect of gamification on the performance of students involved in a software engineering project.},

	Abstract = {Computer science disciplines are very important in the context of an emerging IT industry especially in the Eastern Europe countries where lots of companies invested in research and development sites. The need for highly qualified specialists is very acute and is expressed in several occasions as a request addressed to universities to double the number of bachelor graduates. In this sense universities try to adapt and they provide distance learning programs. In this context all the advantages of software must be used: generative learning objects, gamifications etc. A gamification model for sorting algorithms is proposed in this sense in order to exercise the logic steps of programming and algorithms thus triggering a way of thinking that is needed in the creation of new software. To motivate the student in performing the exercise we used some elements of game mechanics like score and difficulty levels. All the newly created e-learning models are provided to the student through an online Web application.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the setup for a gamified classroom for the subject of Software Engineering. A series of papers have resulted from this work: ``Understanding Student Motivation'' at CSEDU 2013 [1] and ``Bridging the Motivation Gap'', an IGIP SPEED Young Scientist award paper here at ICL 2013 [2]. The intention behind gamifying the course was to increase student engagement and motivation by allowing for independent learning with flexible speed and choice of emphasis. Daniel Pink's [3] motivational theory, which is also found in gamification factors, outlines that autonomy, mastery and purpose lead to these goals. The adopted approach also deals nicely with the vast differences regarding background knowledge and the spread of interest of each of the students. During the latter part of the course a student survey was conducted. Out of 90 students, 59 answered. As a general rule, students did not receive the gamification ideas in a positive light. We examine what went wrong regarding the gamification factors and propose changes for the next iteration of the course.},
