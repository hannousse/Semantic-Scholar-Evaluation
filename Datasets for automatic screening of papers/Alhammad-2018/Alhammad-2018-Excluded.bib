	Abstract = {The use of games in software engineering education is not new. However, recent technologies have provided new opportunities for using games and their elements to enhance learning and student engagement. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss how game related methods have been used in the context of software engineering education by means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game related methods support specific knowledge areas from software engineering. The systematic mapping study identified 106 primary studies describing the use of serious games, gamification and game development in software engineering education. Based on this mapping, we aimed to track the learning goals of each primary study to the knowledge areas defined in ACM/IEEE curricular recommendations. As a result, we observed that "Software Process", "Software Design" and "Profession Practice" are the most recurring knowledge areas explored by game related approaches in software engineering education. We also uncover possible research opportunities for game-related education methods.},

	Abstract = {In specialization courses, normally, the students have concepts from some subjects already consolidated in the undergraduate program. To motivate these students in those disciplines is a challenge to the teacher. The use of "gamification" concepts, that is, application of games in activities that are not games per se, is a methodological solution for the motivation in the classes. In order to evaluate the usage of this technique, an experiment was conducted with a Software Engineering specialization class. The class was divided into teams and through various play activities, the executed works were being scored. Three teaching methodologies were applied: Learning based in problems, based in projects and mental maps. At the end of the course a questionnaire was applied so that the students could evaluate the methodology. The obtained results were satisfactory, because there was a greater engagement of the students during class.},

	Abstract = {The term 'gamification' refers to the use of game elements in non-game environments like education, business, sales and marketing. The method of 'gamifying' has been applied in many different contexts and for many different reasons; for instance, in order to improve productivity, to increase sales, to motivate employees and customers, et al. In recent years, educators began to investigate the effects of different gamification elements within the context of education. There has been a considerable debate regarding the actual effects of gamification on the intrinsic motivation of students towards learning, and many research have been conducted in order to discover the results of 'gamifying' any specific course curriculum. Each research study has revealed another impediment, supported by multiple review studies that revealed significant problems with some of the methods of majority of studies in the research area now known as the 'gamification of education'. This paper explains the design, analysis and implementation process of an open-source gamification platform, which is aimed at providing a gamification platform for education, while also explaining a preliminary survey conducted on an Introduction to Java course. The platform was developed using multiple technologies and frameworks related to the Java programming language while the survey was conducted at third level education students through a quantitative questionnaire.},

	Abstract = {Writing good software tests is difficult, not every software developer's favorite occupation, and not a prominent aspect in programming education. However, human involvement in testing is unavoidable: What makes a test good is often down to intuition; what makes a test useful depends on an understanding of the program context; what makes a test find bugs depends on understanding the intended program behaviour. Because the consequences of insufficient testing can be dire, this paper explores a new angle to address the testing problem: Gamification is the approach of converting potentially tedious or boring tasks to components of entertaining gameplay, where the competitive nature of humans motivates them to compete and excel. By applying gamification concepts to software testing, there is potential to fundamentally change software testing in several ways: First, gamification can help to overcome deficiencies in education, where testing is a highly neglected topic. Second, gamification engages practitioners in testing tasks they would otherwise neglect, and gets them to use advanced testing tools and techniques they would otherwise not consider. Finally, gamification makes it possible to crowdsource complex testing tasks through games with a purpose. Collectively, these applications of gamification have the potential to substantially improve software testing practice, and thus software quality.},

Problem Based Learning (PBL) is an alternative that allows learning through individual practical experiences. The objective of this paper is to report experiences to teach software testing by using PBL in Software Engineering undergraduate course of Federal University of Pampa. The report covers two editions of Problem Solving course that involved 51 students and focused on students creating and running test cases across software components developed by professors. Data collection had been made by questionnaires with open and closed questions, and data was examined by statistics and Content Analysis technique. As results, we notice evidences of knowledge and perceptions maturing by students about software testing and software quality. We also verify it's possible to mix PBL with other teaching methodologies such as gamification and to amplify their benefits.},

	Abstract = {Involving stakeholders in requirements elicitation is a cornerstone of successful requirements engineering (RE). With the recent technological advances, the number of stakeholders of a system has significantly increased. Major stakeholders, end-users in particular, are increasingly difficult to reach, because they may be globally distributed and outside organizational reach, i.e., they are no members of the organizations that are involved in the development of a system. Online elicitation platforms allow to elicit requirements collaboratively from a large number of distributed stakeholders. However, such platforms are not sufficient for motivating stakeholders outside organizational reach to contribute voluntarily. Gamification is a potential means for creating and sustaining such motivation. However, there is little research on stakeholder engagement with gamification so far. Current approaches particularly do not consider that stakeholders learn during elicitation and that their motivational factors also change. In this paper, we address this gap with a motivation concept that is inspired by the theories of experiential learning and need satisfaction. Our contribution is threefold. First, we suggest how to characterize these stakeholders despite not knowing who they are. Second, we show the role of experiential learning and need satisfaction with respect to gamification in the context of requirements elicitation. Third, we present a three-dimensional concept of how to motivate these stakeholders towards requirements elicitation over the whole period of requirements elicitation.},

On the other hand, gamification is widely used to engage and motivate people to accomplish tasks and improve their performance. The goal of this work is to analyze the use of gamification to orient and motivate undergraduate students to overcome onboarding barriers and engage to OSS projects. To achieve this goal, we implemented four gaming elements (Quests, Points, Ranking, and Levels) in GitLab and assessed the environment by means of a study conducted with 17 students, within a real OSS project (JabRef). At the end of the study, the students evaluated their experience through a questionnaire. We found that the Quest element helped to guide participants and keep them motivated and points helped by providing feedback on students' performed tasks. We conclude that the gamified environment oriented the students in an attempt to make a contribution and that gamification can motivate and orient newcomers' to engage to OSS projects.},

This not only contributes to the scarcity of qualified cybersecurity professionals, but the absence of diversity leads to a lack of perspective and differing viewpoints. Part of the problem is that cybersecurity suffers from barriers to entry that include expensive training, exclusionary culture, and the need for costly infrastructure. In order for students to start learning about cybersecurity, access to training, infrastructure and subject matter experts is imperative. The existing Code Hunt framework, used to help students master programming, could be a springboard to help reduce the challenges facing students interested in cybersecurity. Code Hunt offers gamification, community supported development, and a cloud infrastructure that provides an on-ramp to immediate learning. Leveraging Code Hunt's structured gaming model can addresses these weaknesses and makes cybersecurity training more accessible to those without the means or inclination to participate in more traditional cybersecurity competitions.},

	Abstract = {Sophistication and flexibility of software development make it easy to leave security vulnerabilities in software applications for attackers. It is critical to educate and train software engineers to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in software applications in the first place such as adopting secure coding mechanisms and conducting security testing. A number of websites provide training grounds to train people's hacking skills, which are highly related to security testing skills, and train people's secure coding skills. However, there exists no interactive gaming platform for instilling gaming aspects into the education and training of secure coding. To address this issue, we propose to construct secure coding duels in Code Hunt, a high-impact serious gaming platform released by Microsoft Research. In Code Hunt, a coding duel consists of two code segments: a secret code segment and a player-visible code segment. To solve a coding duel, a player iteratively modifies the player-visible code segment to match the functional behaviors of the secret code segment. During the duel-solving process, the player is given clues as a set of automatically generated test cases to characterize sample functional behaviors of the secret code segment. The game aspect in Code Hunt is to recognize a pattern from the test cases, and to re-engineer the player-visible code segment to exhibit the expected behaviors. Secure coding duels proposed in this work are coding duels that are carefully designed to train players' secure coding skills, such as sufficient input validation and access control.},

	Abstract = {Code Hunt (http://www.codehunt.com/) is an educational coding game (that runs in a browser) for teaching and learning computer science at scale. The game consists of a series of worlds and levels, which get increasingly challenging. In each level, the player has to discover a secret code fragment and write code for it. The game has sounds and a leaderboard to keep the player engaged. Code Hunt targets teachers and students from introductory to advanced programming or software engineering courses. In addition, Code Hunt can be used by seasoned developers to hone their programming skills or by companies to evaluate job candidates. At the core of the game experience is an automated program analysis and grading engine based on dynamic symbolic execution. The engine detects any behavioral differences between the player's code and the secret code fragment. The game works in any modern browser, and currently supports C# or Java programs. Code Hunt is a dramatic evolution of our earlier Pex4Fun web platform, from which we have gathered considerable experience (including over 1.4 million programs submitted by users).},

	Abstract = {Context-aware assistive systems (CAAS) have become ubiquitous in cars or smartphones but not in industrial work contexts: while there are systems controlling work results, context-specific assistance during the processes is hardly offered. As a result production workers still have to rely on their skills and expertise. While un-impaired workers may cope well with this situation, elderly or impaired persons in production environments need context-sensitive assistance.
The contribution of the research presented here is three-fold: (1) We provide a framework for context-aware assistive systems in production environments. These systems are based on motion recognition and use projection and elements from game design (gamification) to augment work. (2) Based on this framework we describe a prototype with respect to both the physical and the software implementation. (3) We present the results of a study with impaired workers and quantifying the effects of the augmentations on work speed and quality.},

Studying members of such developer profile aggregators, we found an ecosystem that revolves around the social programmer. Developers are assessing each other to evaluate whether other developers are interesting, worth following, or worth collaborating with. They are self-conscious about being assessed, and thus manage their public images. They value passion for software development, new technologies, and learning. Some recruiters participate in the ecosystem and use it to find candidates for hiring; other recruiters struggle with the interpretation of signals and issues of trust. This mutual assessment is changing how software engineers collaborate and how they advance their skills.},

	Abstract = {In Spain, the new Medicine degrees of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) have incorporated Information Technologies (IT) subjects to develop horizontal competences in their curriculum. Medicine Studies are costly for Higher Education (HE) institutions and, then, every cost-effective educational innovation is welcomed. There are different general approaches for designing and developing serious games in general, but specific target disciplines as Medicine (educational and professional training), lack of tailor-made methodologies, even in eliciting requirements under the Requirements Engineering (RE) framework, as a subfield of Software Engineering. In medical higher education, the main objective of using games is to engage learners in complex problem spaces that replicate real world situations, as it happens in hospital emergencies, surgery operations and so on, without the constraints and risks of the day to day practice (patient injuries, health complications and death). Therefore, the development of serious HE games is a complex, time consuming and costly process, especially for learning medical skills. In this Work in Progress, we address the problem of lacking suitable methodologies in the design and development processes of educational serious games for HE medical environments. Our proposal is a semi-formal and simple method to elicit and formalize the specific teaching needs identified in subjects or practices of Medicine degrees, in order to design and develop serious games based on sound educational principles and theories and on RE rules.},

The goal of this initiative is to develop high quality software products; however, some difficulties related to the learning process can be found in the dynamics interactions of the professional teams within the organization. A potential cause for these difficulties can be attributed to the use and implementation of teaching methodologies with lower levels of team member motivation. Gamification offers a possible solution for these deficiencies providing more thought-provoking environments for the learning experience. In this paper we propose a teaching instrument based on the principles of gamification to achieve a required level of motivation in teams involved in process improvement.

	Abstract = {Research on educational e-courses that contain only a series of motivating elements of computer games but do not include playing computer games has intensified since 2010 [1] [6]. This field of research is called gamification and represents the use of game elements (mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics) in a field (education, marketing etc.) that is not a computer game. A review of literature related to the field of teaching with online courses in information technology (e.g. programming, software engineering) shows that the topic of gamification has so far been inadequately explored, with the lack of theoretical and empirical research that would involve gamification methodology. Previous studies have shown that gamification can have a positive impact on the pedagogical and psychological aspects of e-learning. In this paper empirical research is presented regarding the use of gamification in online teaching of programming. A gamified e-course was designed for the lectures in programming, and a possible positive effect was examined on the usage of learning materials in an experimental group of students who will use a gamified e-course (online system).},

	Abstract = {Gamification is not a newly emerging concept. Perhaps, it is a new term to some people. Gamification is a powerful new strategy to influence and motivate groups of people. It applies game mechanics to non-game activities to change the user's behavior of an application. It improves the engagement of user by keeping score of points earned through various activities on the application. The recent gamified websites or a related service such as Foursquare is a location-based application that pinpoints where you are and your activities. Users of the Foursquare can ``check in'' to various locations on their mobile phones and gain incentives like badges or deals. Gamification is utilised as a mean to build up user loyalty, and not so much to gain their long-term engagement. This article discusses how the gamification can help to drive the sustainability after a mobile application has been delivered and is in use. It is important to make mobile application continuously visible and sustainable if the concept of gamification has been used correctly. The more users can gain from the virtual and tangible rewards of using our application, the more we can be rewarded from our users. It also discusses how adding a ``game layer'' has improved the basic functions in society like educating people to become more responsible and helpful and use badges as virtual reward to users who contribute photos. Interactive mobile application designed to change the way of people report road accident cases with applying a simplicity and convenience principles. For instance, user just needs to snap photo and touch on screen to report a road accident case.},

	Abstract = {Mutation testing is endorsed by software testing researchers for its unique capability of providing pragmatic estimates of a test suite's fault detection capability, and for guiding testers in improving their test suites. In practice, however, wide-spread adoption of mutation testing is hampered because any non-trivial program results in huge numbers of mutants, many of which are either trivial or equivalent, and thus useless. Trivial mutants reduce the motivation of developers in trusting and using the technique, while equivalent mutants are frustratingly difficult to handle. These problems are exacerbated by insufficient education on testing, which often means that mutation testing is not well understood in practice. These are examples of the types of problems that gamification aims to overcome by making such tedious activities competitive and entertaining. In this paper, we introduce the first steps towards building Code Defenders, a mutation testing game where players take the role of an attacker, who aims to create the most subtle non-equivalent mutants, or a defender, who aims to create strong tests to kill these mutants. The benefits of such an approach are manifold: The game can serve an educational role by engaging learners in mutation testing activities in a fun way. Experienced players will produce strong test suites, capable of detecting even the most subtle bugs that other players can conceive. Equivalent mutants are handled by making them a special part of the gameplay, where points are at stake in duels between attackers and defenders.},

	Abstract = {We live in the days of social software where social interactions, from simple notifications to complex business processes, are supported by software platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. But for any social software to be successful, it must be used by a sizeable portion of its intended user community. Usage requirements are usually referred to as Acceptance Requirements and they have been studied in the literature both for general technology as well as software. Operationalization techniques for such requirements often consist of making a game out of software usage where users are rewarded/penalized depending onthe degree of their participation. The game may be competitive or non-competitive, depending on the anticipated personality traits of intended users. Making a game out of usage is often referred to as Gamification, and gamification has attracted huge attention in the literature for the past few years because it offers a novelapproach to software technology usage. This paper proposes a generic framework for designing gamified solutions for acceptance requirements. The framework consists of a generic acceptance goal model that characterizes the problem space by capturing possible refinements for acceptance requirements, and a generic gamification model that capturespossible gamified operationalizations of acceptance requirements. These models have been extracted from the literature and they are highly dependent on context (cognitive and social) elements of the intended user community. The proposed framework isillustrated with the Meeting Scheduler exemplar.},

	Abstract = {In this work we provide an overview of gamification, i.e. the application of methods from game design to enrich non-gaming processes. The contribution is divided into five subsections: an introduction focusing on the progression of gamification through the hype cycle in the recent years (1), a brief introduction to gamification mechanics (1) and an overview of the state of the art in established areas (3). The focus is a discussion of more recent attempts of gamification in service and production (4). We also discuss the ethical implications (5) and the future perspectives (6) of gamified business processes. Gamification has been successfully applied in the domains education (serious games) and health (exergames) and is spreading to other areas. In recent years there have been various attempts to ``gamify'' business processes. While the first efforts date back as far as the collection of miles in frequent flyer programs, we will portray some of the more recent and comprehensive software-based approaches in the service industry, e.g. the gamification of processes in sales and marketing. We discuss their accomplishments as well as their social and ethical implicatio. Finally a very recent approach is presented: the application of gamification in the domain of industrial production. We discuss the special requirements in this domain and the effects on the business level and on the users. We conclude with a prognosis on the future development of gamification.},

	Abstract = {All segments of stakeholders in society need to understand economic, environmental and social connections and implications in order to facilitate sustainable development. Currently many people - especially in emerging countries - are not aware of the challenges associated with sustainability. In addition new technology has to be developed to find solutions for providing growth without exceeding the resource boundaries of our planet. This demands a drastically increased learning and teaching productivity and thus new approaches for education. Exemplarily for engineering education, the authors present a concept in which simulation-games are applied in order to support training for assembly processes on manual workplaces. The Assembly Game and the Gaming System are introduced. The first game is played on portable devices. Learners acquire knowledge of the assembly sequence of a bicycle e-motor. The second game is played on a manual assembly workplace. It encourages practice based learning by combining gaming software with a manual assembly workplace. Both games are implemented in education oriented software with strong visual features. Motion capture technology is used in order to support the immediate response to the user's actions.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we overview the design of tablet apps we designed and built to teach literacy to adults, and present the results and conclusions derived from experiments performed with target users. Low adult literacy is a significant problem with a high economic cost both for the individuals and for society. Programs created to address low adult literacy face access and engagement barriers that tablet software may be able to help overcome. We designed three tablet apps, using two contrasting approaches of incorporating game-design elements to engage the users. We tested the apps with participants from the Brant Skills Centre, a non-profit organization that offers adult literacy programs in Brantford, Ontario. Though participants were divided on whether they preferred the apps to more traditional instruction, most participants preferred using the apps in addition to more traditional instruction. Based on this we conclude that gamification and serious game design approaches were effective at increasing learner engagement, and we propose a direction for future research.},

	Abstract = {Remote sites in South Africa can be characterized by a lack of inter-city transport, lack of societal infrastructure, and minimal computing resources and access to them. As a result, Kindergarten-12th Grade (K-12) education has not used many features of educational technology that require significant bandwidth. This case study analyzes the availability and uses of teaching techniques and computing technologies in Grades 10, 11, and 12 Computer Applications Technology classes in a remote town in South Africa. The technologies and techniques trialed showed promise of usefulness in being more engaging to student interest than those presently used. Some students, who desired a job in IT in the future, were more motivated and remembered more than others. The technologies were a bit tricky in setting up and it was recommended that the researchers, in addition to special work sessions with the teachers, team taught with the teachers for their first time using the technologies. For advanced students, a computer club was recommended that might allow students to explore subjects and job opportunities that did not fit within their class structure. Human factors issues focussed on ease of use and intuitiveness of technologies for both teachers and students. Classes are only 50minutes and, within so short a time, if the technology becomes a hurdle rather than a vehicle for teaching a class concept, it defeats its own purpose. Thus, technologies need to be selected carefully and all supporting technology needs to be installed and ready for use. For companies developing K-12 technologies, if they have a preference for e.g., browsers, they should provide a hyperlink to the download site for their users. Also, all software should have a one-page summary of commands and software use.},

	Abstract = {Using competitions to motivate students is a well-known practice that has proved to be successful. Nevertheless, grading students only through their results in the competition could unfairly limit the range of grades that each student can get: regardless of the quality of the different teams participating, one student must necessarily win the tournament, another must be second, and so on until the last place. In fact, player rankings are relative assessments that are conditioned by the performance of every student. In this paper, we propose solving this issue by making students do a code review before betting on the competition. By betting, the grade of students depends both on the performance of their own solution and the one they bet on. This way, grades represent not only coding skills, but also code analysis skills, widening the attainable range of grades and allowing for a fairer grade distribution. As a result, students that are not so proficient in coding are rewarded if they demonstrate they can do a good analysis of the source code written by others, which is a very valuable skill in the professional world. We provide a case study in an undergraduate course, showing positive results.},

In this paper, we present a first step towards using video game elements and Artificial Intelligence Tutoring system techniques to teach mathematical concepts such as factoring and the quadratic formula. These concepts are explained in a way that helps learners make a connection between the mathematical concepts and their real life experience. These methods of learning are supported by several studies (Bonwell & Eison, 1991; Donovan & Bransford, 2004; Scarlatos, 2006). We use gamification techniques during the training and test phases to help students learn the mathematical concepts. We then compare the performance of students who used our system (MathDungeon) with that of students who used the most popular math tutoring programs used in US colleges: Assessment and Learning, K-12, Higher Education (ALEKS). The number of students who used MathDungeon and scored above the median score on the test of math performance was greater than the number of students who used ALEKS and scored higher than the median score.},
