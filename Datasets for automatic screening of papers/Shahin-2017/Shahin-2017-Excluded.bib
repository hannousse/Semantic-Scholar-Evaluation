	Abstract = {Offloading mobile traffic to WiFi networks (WiFi Offloading) is a cost-effective technique to alleviate the pressure on mobile networks for meeting the surge of data capacity demand. However, most existing proposals from standards developing organizations (SDOs) and research communities are facing a deployment dilemma, either due to overlooking device limitations, lack user incentives, or missing operator supports. In this position paper, we introduce an open-source platform for WiFi offloading to tackle the deployment challenge. Our solution leverages the programmable feature of software-defined networking (SDN) to enhance extensibility and deployability in a collaborative manner. Inspired by our field measurements covering 4G/LTE and 802.11ac/n, we exploit context awareness as a use case to demonstrate the efficacy of our solution. We also discuss the potential usage by cloud service providers given the opportunities behind the growing popularity of mobile virtual network operators (MVNO). We have released our platform under open-source licenses to encourage future collaboration and development with SDOs and research communities.},

	Abstract = {Today's cellular networks are built with``macro cell'' basestations connected to the Internet via a rigid, complicated backhaul. Even with state-of-art technologies like LTE, users get limited throughput and high latency, with high variance. Performance enhancing IP boxes are deployed in the cellular operator's datacenters, far from the user. As a result, the most compelling cloudlet applications are difficult to realize on such networks and cloudlet researchers have thus far focused on Wi-Fi networks only.
We argue that the cloudlet community should consider small cell networks in addition to Wi-Fi networks. Small cells, such as femtocells and picocells, are relatively new additions to the cellular standards. By reducing the cell size compared to the traditional macro cells, they increase spatial reuse of precious licensed frequencies. Users get higher bandwidth and lower latency, with relatively less variance. This architecture, where small cells are deployed simply with power and Ethernet connectivity, lends itself well to cloudlet augmentation. In this position paper, we describe why deployed macro cell basestations are unsuitable for cloudlet deployment. In contrast, we describe why a small cell architecture is amenable for cloudlet deployments. Our experience from operating a small cell testbed in licensed frequencies matches that reported by equipment vendors. The applications we care about require high throughput and low latency. In a cellular network this can be achieved today by augmenting small cells with powerful cloudlets.},

	Abstract = {The verification of Multiagent Systems (MAS) and Distributed Software Systems (DSS) has taken a special attention due to the growing demand of having DSS in recent years. The distributed functionality and lack of having a central control in MAS and DSS may cause to emerge new behaviors in the execution time. This unexpected behavior which was not seen in the requirements is known as emergent behavior and may cause irreparable damages. Detection of these emergent behaviors is more valuable and cost effective in the early phases compared to detecting them after the deployment. In this paper we propose a new technique for the detection of a specific type of emergent behavior in the design phase. We take the advantage of social network visualization in this method. The novelty and direct advantage of this technique is presenting the exact point and cause of emergent behavior.},

	Abstract = {The world-wide-web provides a great means for delivering information services to a university community[1,2]. An unexpected side-effect of using the web to deliver information services is that a community member can develop new services independent of the computing services department. As an example, one of the authors (a computer science student at California State University Chico) has independently developed a tool to help students create class schedules. This tool reads course information from the university's public web pages and uses it to automatically create custom class schedules for individual students. Over five thousand students (nearly half of all registering students) used this tool to create their Fall 2005 schedules.This paper presents the development and deployment of the scheduling tool as an example of information services volunteerism. It includes a description of the genesis of the tool, a discussion of how it has been integrated into the university supported information services, and an overview of the scheduling tool.},

	Abstract = {Distributed acoustic sensing underlies an increasingly important class of sensor network applications, from habitat monitoring and bioacoustic census to security applications and virtual fences. VoxNet is a complete hardware and software platform for distributed acoustic monitoring applications that focuses on three key goals: (1) rapid deployment in realistic environments; (2) a high level programming language that abstracts the user from platform and network details and compiles into a high performance distributed application; and (3) an interactive usage model based on run-time installable programs, with the ability to run the same high level program seamlessly over live or stored data. The VoxNet hardware is self-contained and weather-resistant, and supports a four-channel microphone array with automated time synchronization, localization, and network coordination. Using VoxNet, an investigator can visualize phenomena in real-time, develop and tune online analysis, and record raw data for off-line analysis and archival. This paper describes both the hardware and software elements of the platform, as well as the architecture required to support distributed programs running over a heterogeneous network. We characterize the performance of the platform, using both microbenchmarks that evaluate specific aspects of the platform and a real application running in the field.},

To survive in this fierce competition, software developers are searching for methods and tools to develop various products with reduced time-to-market and improved quality.
In response to these needs, we present a new CASE called VULCAN. VULCAN is a software development workbench comprising various tools for supporting the entire phases of feature-oriented product line software development from feature modeling to asset and product development. Especially, it provides several tools for supporting architecture-model-based software development where: (1) product line architectures can be specified using various architecture patterns, (2) application-specific architectures can be derived from the product line architecture specifications, (3) application-specific control components can be generated from the application architecture specifications, and (4) different deployment architectures can be configured with various component communication mechanisms. Of various tools included in VULCAN, we focus on this tool set for supporting architecture-model-based software development in this paper and demonstration.},

	Abstract = {The pull-based development model, enabled by git and popularised by collaborative coding platforms like BitBucket, Gitorius, and GitHub, is widely used in distributed software teams. While this model lowers the barrier to entry for potential contributors (since anyone can submit pull requests to any repository), it also increases the burden on integrators (i.e., members of a project's core team, responsible for evaluating the proposed changes and integrating them into the main development line), who struggle to keep up with the volume of incoming pull requests. In this paper we report on a quantitative study that tries to resolve which factors affect pull request evaluation latency in GitHub. Using regression modeling on data extracted from a sample of GitHub projects using the Travis-CI continuous integration service, we find that latency is a complex issue, requiring many independent variables to explain adequately.},

	Abstract = {Increasing energy consumption of commercial buildings has motivated numerous energy tracking and monitoring systems in the recent years. A particular area that is less explored in this domain is that of energy apportionment whereby total energy usage of a shared space such as a building is disaggregated to attribute it to an individual occupant. This particular scenario of individual apportionment is important for increased transparency in the actual energy consumption of shared living spaces in commercial buildings e.g. hotels, student dormitories and hospitals amongst others. Accurate energy accounting is a difficult problem to solve using only a single smart meter. In this paper, we present a novel, scalable and a low cost energy apportionment system called WattShare that builds upon our EnergyLens architecture, where data from a common electricity meter and smartphones (carried by the occupants) is fused, and then used for detailed energy disaggregation. This information is then used to measure the room-level energy consumption. We evaluate WattShare using a week long deployment conducted in a student dormitory in a campus in India. We show that WattShare is able to disaggregate the total energy usage from a single smart meter to individual rooms with an average precision of 96.42% and average recall of 94.96%. WattShare achieves 86.42% energy apportionment accuracy which increases to 94.57% when an outlier room is removed.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in networks, information and computation grids, and the Web have resulted in the proliferation of a multitude of physically distributed and autonomously developed component Web services. The W3C Web Services Architecture defines "Web service as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine processible format (specifically WSDL) and other systems can interact with it in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other Web-related standards". So, web-services constitute a distributed computing infrastructure made up of many different systems trying to communicate over the Internet to virtually form a single logical system. Web-services are an effective means for linking loosely coupled systems together using a technology that does not bind to a particular component model, programming language or platform. Used according to the semantic web principles, semantic web services offer key integration capabilities in businesses as well as in scientific research over the Internet and corporate intranets, and so are applicable to a broad variety of applications including e-Enterprise, e-Business, e-Government, and e-Science. Correspondingly, the construction and deployment of composite services by combining and reusing independently developed component services is an important capability in the emerging Web-based computing infrastructure. In this presentation we will focus on a detailed analysis of existing discovery reasoning mechanisms and the current key solutions for composition of component services. We will conclude with current roadblocks and pilot applications.},

	Abstract = {Cities have benefited from the three greatest technological innovations of the past 200 years: the steam engine, electrification, and the automobile. But each advance has created its own challenges, including pollution, overcrowding, sprawl. As the digital revolution transforms cities once again, how can we make sure it improves quality of life while minimizing the downside? With population density comes the possibility of deploying network connectivity and wayfinding at lower cost, but density also increases complexity of deployment. How can digital technology reduce the bad friction of urban environments, such as congestion, cost, and complexity, while increasing good friction, such as all of the serendipitous interactions that cities encourage? Underlying all this change is ubiquitous connectivity and mobile technology, from the phones people carry with them to the supporting devices and network endpoints embedded in the urban infrastructure. Sidewalk Labs is an Alphabet company that works with cities to develop new technology that can improve urban life. We will discuss some of our discoveries and beliefs, and talk about our plans to use mobile technology to help cities take full advantage of the digital revolution.},

VISTAS' goal is not only to devise visualizations that help ecologists in research and in communicating that research, but also to evaluate the visualizations and software. Thus, we ask "which visualizations work, for what purpose, and for which audiences," and our project involves equal participation of ecologists, computer scientists, and social scientists. We have begun to study visualization use by ecologists, assessed some existing software products, and implemented a prototype. This position paper reports how we apply social science methods in establishing context for VISTAS' evaluation and development. We describe our initial surveys of ecologists and ecology journals to determine current visualization use, outline our visualization evaluation strategies, and in conclusion pose questions critical to the evaluation, deployment, and adoption of VISTAS and VISTAS-like visualizations and software.},

@inproceedings{Serakiotou:2008::1449956.1450009,
	Abstract = {Most Information Technology Departments in academia have their historical roots in a culture best described by words such as "geeks," "beta-testers," "troubleshooters," "debuggers," "early adopters," and so on. This culture was partly created by the fact that the mission of academia is indeed to keep looking forward to new developments and cutting-edge technologies. It is the role of industry to adopt the outcome of academia's frenetic efforts to move forward and to then produce commodity-like products.
At the same time, in most academic institutions, Information Technology Departments have also evolved into providers of services that use mature but still evolving technology. The consumers (customers) have come to treat these technologies as commodity products or utilities, and they expect to be able to easily learn how to use them, and to be able to easily figure out what are the services offered and how they can be configured.
In such an environment, "deployment cycles" and "personnel training" are often seen as a complete waste of time by the academics, as they themselves are pushing for the next generation of technology to be adopted by IT as fast as possible. For these reasons, the creation of detailed documentation by technical writers is usually not deemed worth funding, and with the advent of internet searches and FAQ blogging is seen often as completely unnecessary. This is a true statement for many areas of technology, where there exists ambient literature and FAQs (such as any MS Office product, for example). It is disastrous for customer satisfaction though, if it is applied on issues of configuration that are specific to the institution.
Nevertheless, this type of documentation, the kind that describes "how do we do things here" is also passed up as a secondary, non-glamorous task. The fact that usually "the way we do things" also changes very rapidly, adds another layer of discouragement to webmasters and FAQ owners to try to keep up and maintain relevant content.
The final issue that IT departments also have to grapple with is the thin staffing and the fact that even if technical writers were at hand, the staff that "owns" the information to be documented does not have time to explain it or relay it to others.
This was the kind of impossible situation that Rice University Information Technology had reached: stale documentation, orphaned ownership of the content, a customer base that was very conducive to using documentation and very resentful of the fact that we were not providing any. We experimented with "wiki" technology and we experimented with involving different groups within IT as potential technical writers. We were able to overcome the impasse and discovered some added benefits that have affected the training that we offer to our customer base.},

	Abstract = {Giving up on something you know in order to risk the unknown usually proves to be a challenge. It is customary to have created a comfortable atmosphere of using what's now considered the old, but there is a demand for the new. So now is the time to learn, explore and ultimately understand the new. This new version of Windows is radically different from the old version. It requires much time, patience and planning, which in the Information Technology world is something we do not have. This requires us to collectively pool our experiences together and collaborate to achieve our goals.
Windows XP has been around for a long time and most have become comfortable in developing and deploying it. Windows 7 offers a substantial upgrade from Windows XP in regards to features for users, but not necessarily for image developers. Image developers are discovering that creating a Windows 7 image is not an easy process compared to using Windows XP. It requires undergoing extensive test trials, researching new approaches to conduct old tasks, and giving up on features that can no longer be achieved using this new operating system.
At Lewis & Clark College, we have migrated all of our PC computers and dual-boot labs to Windows 7 64-bit from Windows XP. We overcame many obstacles while striving to meet our goals.

	Abstract = {Agriculture accounts for a significant portion of the GDP in most developed countries. However, managing farms, particularly large-scale extensive farming systems, is hindered by lack of data and increasing shortage of labour. We have deployed a large heterogeneous sensor network on a working farm to explore sensor network applications that can address some of the issues identified above. Our network is solar powered and has been running for over 6 months. The current deployment consists of over 40 moisture sensors that provide soil moisture profiles at varying depths, weight sensors to compute the amount of food and water consumed by animals, electronic tag readers, up to 40 sensors that can be used to track animal movement (consisting of GPS, compass and accelerometers), and 20 sensor/actuators that can be used to apply different stimuli (audio, vibration and mild electric shock) to the animal. The static part of the network is designed for 24/7 operation and is linked to the Internet via a dedicated high-gain radio link, also solar powered. The initial goals of the deployment are to provide a testbed for sensor network research in programmability and data handling while also being a vital tool for scientists to study animal behavior. Our longer term aim is to create a management system that completely transforms the way farms are managed.},

	Abstract = {As part of a complete wireless networking education, students must have an in-depth understanding of basic concepts such as signal propagation, environmental effects on RF signals, FCC regulations and limits, power levels, antenna construction and antenna operation. Lecture based curricula can only go so far in preparing a wireless professional to succeed in industry. To be complete, the student must have practical experience.Our wireless coursework is comprised of three courses, the first of which is a wireless concepts course. This course has a significant hands-on component that requires students to understand the tools while applying what they are learning about the physical layer and basic network operation. The students engage in two very large projects; a wireless building survey and signal propagation testing using specialized equipment.As part of the projects, students create a series of experiments with a variety of equipment and provide useable test data. Examples of the tests include interference, Fresnel zone effects, throughput, range and the effects of multi-path on signals. However, in the presence of an increasing number of wireless networks, obtaining real world, reliable data illustrating the various physical layer phenomena is difficult. Our solution was to build several wireless carts outfitted with various antennas, transmission equipment from different portions of the spectrum and that used different encoding or modulation techniques. In addition, a major requirement was that the carts be able to operate away from infrastructure support, including AC power.The carts have enabled students to isolate themselves from other wireless signals and have provided an extremely adaptive platform for experiments and projects. This paper will describe the coursework, projects, functions, costs, lessons learned and the data gathered as a result of their deployment.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, wireless sensor networks have been used in applications of data gathering and target localization across large geographical areas. In this paper, we study the issues involved in applying wireless sensor networks to search and rescue of lost hikers in trails and focus on the optimal placement of sensors and access points such that the cost of search and rescue is minimized. Particularly, we address two problems: a) how to identify the lost hiker position as accurately as possible, i.e., obtain a small trail segments containing the lost hiker; and (b) how to search efficiently in trail segments for different trail topologies and search agent capabilities. For the optimal access point deployment problem, we propose theoretical models that consider both efficiency and accuracy criteria and present analytical results for simpler trail topologies. For complicated graph topologies, we develop efficient heuristic algorithms with various heuristics. After access point deployment is decided, the actual cost of search in individual trail segment can be computed. We analyze four different types of search and rescue agents, present algorithms to find the optimal search paths for each one of them, and compute their search costs. The algorithms are developed based on solving Chinese Postman problems. Finally, we present extensive experimental results to examine the accuracy of the mathematical models and compare the performances of different methods. A heuristic method, divide-merge, is shown to outperform all others and finds near-optimal solutions.},

The goal of this project was to monitor vital signs, envi- ronmental conditions and positions of firefighters in a large indoor emergency scenario using a meshed WSN. The WSN consists of one node for each firefighter which transports the data to the mesh network and which is also connected to a Body Area Network (BAN) [8]. The BAN itself consists of several nodes placed into protective suits. The main requirement to all parts of the system is robustness against all kinds of extreme environmental conditions, like extreme air temperatures up to 800$\,^{\circ}$C, extreme humidity up to 100% including condensation and wet walls in unknown buildings.
We report on an experimental evaluation of the deployment of a prototype that addresses the concern of monitoring firefighters in extreme environmental conditions. This will establish the general feasibility of WSN in extreme conditions and show that precise indoor localization using radio runtime measurements is not affected by these conditions.},

	Abstract = {There have been many response deficiencies cited regarding a fire department's ability to fight a structure fire. The attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11 highlighted many of these problems and demanded the attention of the world. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can benefit fire fighters as they bravely enter a structure fire. WSNs are networks consisting of many small sensors or nodes. The sensors can monitor a variety of data, such as the environment, movement and patient health readings. There has been much research completed in the area of WSNs but most of this research is proven via simulations with little actual experimentation or deployment of devices. Wireless sensor networks is an exciting and a new area of research; it has captured the interest of many researchers. The intrigue easily attracts the attention of students as well. With the help of various students, a wireless sensor network will be deployed in a fire training center to test a deployment in a structure. The primary measurement will be the performance of the sensors and the sensor network. Several students have been utilized to assist in writing the necessary programs, and more will continue to contribute to the project. This project will maintain research in utilizing WSNs in a fire fighting scenario and will continue to employ students to get them excited about learning and research.},

	Abstract = {Orchestrating service-oriented workflows is typically based on a design model that routes both data and control through a single point -- the centralised workflow engine. This causes scalability problems that include the unnecessary consumption of the network bandwidth, high latency in transmitting data between the services, and performance bottlenecks. These problems are highly prominent when orchestrating workflows that are composed from services dispersed across distant geographical locations. This paper presents a novel workflow partitioning approach, which attempts to improve the scalability of orchestrating large-scale workflows. It permits the workflow computation to be moved towards the services providing the data in order to garner optimal performance results. This is achieved by decomposing the workflow into smaller sub workflows for parallel execution, and determining the most appropriate network locations to which these sub workflows are transmitted and subsequently executed. This paper demonstrates the efficiency of our approach using a set of experimental workflows that are orchestrated over Amazon EC2 and across several geographic network regions.},

Effective auto scaling of the Cloud resources in accordance to the incoming user demand and thereby reducing the idle resources is one optimum solution which not only reduces the excess energy consumptions but also helps maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS). Whilst achieving such tasks, estimating the user demand in advance with reliable level of accuracy has become an integral and vital component. With this in mind, this research work is aimed at analyzing the Cloud workloads and further evaluating the performances of two widely used prediction techniques such as Markov modelling and Bayesian modelling with 7 hours of Google cluster data. An important outcome of this research work is the categorization and characterization of the Cloud workloads which will assist leading into the user demand prediction parameter modelling.},

	Abstract = {Operator-based programming languages provide an effective development model for large scale stream processing applications. A stream processing application consists of many runtime deployable software processing elements (PE) that work in flows to process incoming messages. Operators (OP) are logical building blocks hosted by PEs. One or more OPs can be fused into a PE at compile-time. Performance optimization for our streaming system includes compile-time fusion optimization and runtime PE-to-host deployment. One of the goals of an optimized stream application is to use minimal computing resource to sustain maximal message throughput.
Characterizing the resource usage of PEs is critical for performance optimization. During compile-time optimization, OP-level resource usage is used to predict the resource usage of fused PEs. When starting an application, PE-level resource usage is used as an initial estimation by the scheduler. In this paper, we propose an efficient workload characterization approach for data stream processing systems. Our method includes the procedures for obtaining reusable OP-level resource usage information from profiling data and recomposing OP-level profiles to predict PE-level resource usage. We present several techniques to overcome measurement errors from the OP data collection. The impact of hardware speed and multi-threading contention on hyper-threading and multi-core machines are also studied. We show that our method can be applied to several streaming applications and the prediction of the PE CPU resource usage is within 15% of the actual CPU usage.},

User-friendly campaign authoring tools are being explored as ways to facilitate the rapid deployment of VGI applications, but many of these tools necessarily enforce a restricted vocabulary of interface elements and database models, limiting their usefulness for more complex VGI project workflows. In contrast, we propose a highly modular, open-source approach that enables reuse of general-purpose components created to facilitate common design patterns -- without enforcing any hard limitations on the database model or interface. The framework builds off of and extends numerous existing open-source projects and leverages open standards (e.g. HTML5), which means it will work across all popular mobile devices as well as desktop browsers. The ideas behind wq arose from our ongoing efforts to generalize an existing data collection application initially created for community-based stream quality monitoring. In this paper we justify the design decisions made in creating wq and suggest general principles that should be taken into consideration when designing systems for collecting, storing, and utilizing VGI.},

	Abstract = {Large cluster-based cloud computing platforms increasingly use commodity Ethernet technologies, such as Gigabit Ethernet, 10GigE, and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), for intra-cluster communication. Traffic congestion can become a performance concern in the Ethernet due to consolidation of data, storage, and control traffic over a common layer-2 fabric, as well as consolidation of multiple virtual machines (VMs) over less physical hardware. Even as networking vendors race to develop switch-level hardware support for congestion management, we make the case that virtualization has opened up a complementary set of opportunities to reduce or even eliminate network congestion in cloud computing clusters. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system called XCo, that performs explicit coordination of network transmissions over a shared Ethernet fabric to proactively prevent network congestion. XCo is a software-only distributed solution executing only in the end-nodes. A central controller uses explicit permissions to temporally separate (at millisecond granularity) the transmissions from competing senders through congested links. XCo is fully transparent to applications, presently deployable, and independent of any switch-level hardware support. We present a detailed evaluation of our XCo prototype across a number of network congestion scenarios, and demonstrate that XCo significantly improves network performance during periods of congestion.},

	Abstract = {A multitude of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) have been implemented with XML Schemas. While such DSLs are well adopted and flexible, they miss modern DSL editor functionality. Moreover, since XML is primarily designed as a machine-processible format, artifacts defined with XML-based DSLs lack comprehensibility and, therefore, maintainability. In order to tackle these shortcomings, we propose a bridge between the XML Schema Definition (XSD) language and text-based metamodeling languages. This bridge exploits existing seams between the technical spaces XMLware, modelware, and grammarware as well as closes identified gaps. The resulting approach is able to generate Xtext-based editors from XSDs providing powerful editor functionality, customization options for the textual concrete syntax style, and round-trip transformations enabling the exchange of data between the involved technical spaces. We evaluate our approach by a case study on TOSCA, which is an XML-based standard for defining Cloud deployments. The results show that our approach enables bridging XMLware with modelware and grammarware in several ways going beyond existing approaches and allows the automated generation of editors that are at least equivalent to editors manually built for XML-based languages.},

	Abstract = {Large scale deployment of sensors is essential to practical applications in cyber physical systems. For instance, instrumenting a commercial building for 'smart energy' management requires deployment and operation of thousands of measurement and metering sensors and actuators that direct operation of the HVAC system. Each of these sensors need to be named consistently and constantly calibrated. Doing this process manually is not only time consuming but also error prone given the scale, heterogeneity and complexity of buildings as well as lack of uniform naming schemas. To address this challenge, we propose Zodiac - a framework for automatically classifying, naming and managing sensors based on active learning from sensor metadata. In contrast to prior work, Zodiac requires minimal user input in terms of labelling examples while being more accurate. To evaluate Zodiac, we deploy it across four real buildings on our campus and label the ground truth metadata for all the sensors in these buildings manually. Using a combination of hierarchical clustering and random forest classifiers we show that Zodiac can successfully classify sensors with an average accuracy of 98% with 28% fewer training examples when compared to a regular expression based method.},

This study tries to find answers on how a biomorphic model can be implemented in the cloud in order to achieve adaptive cloud behaviour. The process of cellular differentiation where cells transform from one type to another, is chosen to be the foundation model for a developed technical model. We define analogies to the cloud where stem cells are blank servers and web servers are cells with a specific function. With a combination of configuration management, version control and cloud deployment systems, an imitation of this biological process is applied in the cloud. The use of automated cloud scaling as a case of adaptive behaviour is the main goal of the research. One approach has been developed for mapping the biological model to the cloud which consists of a prototype where the signal detection and node activation is being triggered by using the concept of random generated timers. The obtained performance results were varying, depending on the general timer distribution, providing new ideas for future improvements and different algorithm proposals.},

	Abstract = {With the evolution of internet towards web 2.0 and real time communications and the adoption of IMS by telecommunications service providers, SIP becomes the next major protocol that application developer may want to rely on to develop their latest applications.
As SIP specifications stabilize, SIP application server become well understood entities. In fact most application servers, like J2EE, now support SIP servlet containers. As a result it become essential to understand how such SIP applications should interact with other web or IT applications.
In this paper, we describe a call control driven MVC programming model for converged applications, defined as application that mix Web and SIP. The programming model is then generalized to any call or media control situation.
As most telecommunications networks, in particular mobile network evolve towards the IMS, such programming model is expected to become essential to the development of future IMS mobile applications. It is in fact not limited to mobile, but extends to any application on network deploying IP (internet, broadband, wired and wireless with or without IMS as well as converged applications that provides a same experience across multiple such access networks).
The programming model presented in this paper can be extended to rely on the notion of enabler, thereby supporting the combination of call control with other mobile, voice and communication features and the deployment over any network (IMS, SIP and other SIP deployments as well as legacy networks (e.g. PSTN and IN)).},

Unfortunately, addressing such feedback is not always straightforward, even when a team is fully invested in user-centered design. To investigate what constrains a teams evolution decisions, we performed a 6-month field study of a team employing iterative user-centered design methods to the design, deployment and evolution of a web application for a university community. Across interviews with the team, analyses of their bug reports, and further interviews with both users and non-adopters of the application, we found most of the constraints on addressing user feedback emerged from conflicts between users heterogeneous use of information and inflexible assumptions in the team's software architecture derived from earlier user research. These findings highlight the need for new approaches to expressing and validating assumptions from user research as software evolves.},

Quality of Service attributes of deployments and network links are taken into account to decide between workflows that are identical in terms of their functionality. Several heuristic approaches have been proposed to solve the resulting QoS-aware service selection problem, known to be NP-hard. In our previous work, motivated by two concrete application scenarios, we proposed a blackboard and a genetic algorithm and compared them in terms of solution quality, performance and scalability. In order to seamlessly run and evaluate further approaches and parallel versions of the current algorithms in a distributed environment, a general framework for service selection optimization has been implemented using Cloud Computing resources. A performance study on sequential and parallel blackboard and genetic algorithms for solving service selection problems has been carried out in the Cloud.},

However, the current OMG DDS specification does not define coordination and discovery services for DDS message brokers, which are used in wide area network deployments of DDS. This paper describes preliminary research on a cloud-enabled coordination service for DDS message brokers, PubSubCoord, to overcome these limitations. Our approach provides a novel solution that brings together (a) ZooKeeper, which is used for the distributed coordination logic between message brokers, (b) DDS Routing Service, which is used to bridge DDS endpoints connected to different networks, and (c) BlueDove, which is used to provide a single-hop message delivery between brokers. Our design can support publishers and subscribers that dynamically join and leave their subnetworks.},

In the health domain, mobile devices are an essential part of patient self-management approaches, where local clinical decision support is applied to ensure that patients receive timely clinical findings. Currently, increases in mobile device capabilities have enabled the deployment of Semantic Web technologies on mobile platforms, enabling the consumption of rich, semantically described health data. To make this semantic health data available to local decision support as well, Semantic Web reasoning should be deployed on mobile platforms. However, there is currently a lack of software solutions and performance analysis of mobile, Semantic Web reasoning engines. This paper presents and compares the mobile benchmarks of 4 reasoning engines, applied on a dataset and rule set for patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF). In particular, these benchmarks investigate the scalability of the mobile reasoning processes, and study reasoning performance for different process flows in decision support. For the purpose of these benchmarks, we extended a number of existing rule engines and RDF stores with Semantic Web reasoning capabilities.},

However, current approaches are either bound to existing client-server-based infrastructures or use closed data sources and proprietary data formats. Moreover, a number of related approaches are built upon content-based recognition algorithms that are both memory and processing-intensive, require a permanent connection to a host, and thus are inappropriate for a direct deployment onto mobile devices. In this work, we present a computational model that builds on a sensor-based tracking approach and maps proactively replicated Linked Data sets to a virtual representation of the user's vicinity computed by a mathematical model. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through a proof-of-concept AR application that retrieves and aggregates mountain-specific data from a set of different sources and displays such data in a live-view interface. In consequence, our approach is resource-efficient, does not require a permanent network connection, is independent from existing server-based infrastructures, and allows to process Linked Data directly on a mobile device.},

	Abstract = {The quality of software has become more important to software companies in the past years. Software measurement is one of many approaches that is used to check the quality of software [18]. This may involve measuring some attributes of a software product or a software process and comparing these measurements to each other or to some desirable level. A software metric is "any type of measurement that relates to a software system, process or related documentation" [7]. Software metrics can help to improve the quality of the produced software. However, metrics and metrics tools are still not used in most software companies -- for example in the 3 companies where we cooperated in last 5 years. One reason is that there is lack of knowledge about metrics and hence software metrics are still unknown or difficult to use for some developers, and software measurement is still time-consuming for managers. Another reason is that, good metrics tools are still expensive for small and middle companies. In our opinion the effectiveness of metrics can be improved by simple organizational expedients. In this paper we present new/adapted requirements on metrics in CASE tools to define flexible product quality models. For this quality model we tried to use some standard techniques, e.g. metrics suite, metrics visualization or metrics filtering to show how metrics in CASE tools can be defined and how it can benefit different people who are involved in a software deployment.},

	Abstract = {Smart use of business intelligence (BI) can allow organizations to leverage the huge amounts of transactional data at their disposal and turn it into a powerful decision support mechanism that gives them competitive advantage. Despite the potential benefits of an effective BI system, the adoption and use of BI systems within the enterprise remains low, especially among smaller companies with resource constraints. This can partly be explained by the predominant deployment approach available today in which a firm needs to procure, install, configure and operate a BI system in-house. Barriers of high cost, complexity and lack of in-house expertise discourage many firms from adopting BI systems. This paper argues that adopting a cloud computing model, where BI is offered as a service over the Internet can lower these barriers and accelerate the pace of BI adoption. However, migrating BI systems from traditional on-premise environments to the cloud presents huge challenges. There are technical, economic, organizational and regulatory hurdles to overcome. Further, BI systems are multi-component (ETL, Data warehouse, data marts, OLAP, reporting, data mining etc.) and deciding which component(s) to move to the cloud, and which ones to leave on-premise needs careful consideration. In addition, the fact that cloud computing is still in its infancy means there is a general lack of conceptual and architectural frameworks to guide companies considering migrating enterprise systems to the cloud. This paper takes a closer look into traditional BI and proposes a conceptual framework that companies can use to chart an adoption path for cloud BI. The framework combines attributes of IT outsourcing, traditional BI, cloud computing as well as decision theory to present a consolidated view of cloud BI. The domain of South African Higher Education was chosen as the target in which the framework will be tested.},

Smart grids utilize ICT entities to enhance efficiency, reliability and sustainability of power generation and distribution network. Majority of the architectures proposed hitherto focus only on a specific architectural aspect, like communication, storage, processing requirement, etc. Recent studies have shown that lack of knowledge on which architecture best satisfies certain information management requirements has hindered large scale smart grid deployments. In this paper, we investigate the cost-benefit analysis of four data processing architectures for various applications in smart grid. We introduce several key cost indicators to analyze hierarchical data processing architectures for the smart grid. In our evaluation, we consider realistic deployments for both dense and sparse environments. Results reported here are significant for smart grid designers, who can use them to discern the architecture that best fits the system requirements.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a method to synchronize data from multiple sensors in a cyber-physical system without any software or hardware modifications to the sensors. This method allows for synchronization of low-power embedded systems in heterogeneous sensor networks, regardless of accuracy of individual sensor clocks by using the events in the physical world to drive the synchronization in the cyber world. We propose two methods to select portions of sensor data streams to drive the synchronization: one leveraging the notion of known templates and the other using an information theoretic approach. Using the events as well as cues from the delay models, we determine alignment points between the data streams. These alignment points are used to synchronize the data. This novel approach is based solely on the sensor data for synchronization, and it can be applied post-deployment on systems of heterogeneous sensors that are not well designed and lack effective synchronization. Experiments show an average accuracy improvement from ~12000ppm to ~2400ppm for a template based-method and from ~12000 to ~277ppm and ~445ppm for information theoretic methods when comparing the synchronized (corrected) clock data to an ideal clock source.},

@article{Wu:2016:DOS:3001754.2983642,
	Abstract = {With the prosperity of media streaming applications over the Internet in the past decades, multimedia data has sharply increased (categorized as multimedia big data), which exerts more pressure on the infrastructure, such as networking of the application provider. In order to move this hurdle, an increasing number of traditional media streaming applications have migrated from a private server cluster onto the cloud. With the elastic resource provisioning and centralized management of the cloud, the operational costs of media streaming application providers can decrease dramatically. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing migration solutions do not fully take viewer information such as hardware condition into consideration. In this article, we consider the deployment optimization problem named ODP by leveraging local memories at each viewer. Considering the NP-hardness of calculating the optimal solution, we turn to propose computationally tractable algorithms. Specifically, we unfold the original problem into two interactive subproblems: coarse-grained migration subproblem and fine-grained scheduling subproblem. Then, the corresponding offline approximation algorithms with performance guarantee and computational efficiency are given. The results of extensive evaluation show that compared with the baseline algorithm without leveraging local memories at viewers, our proposed algorithms and their online versions can decrease total bandwidth reservation and enhance the utilization of bandwidth reservation dramatically.},

In this paper, we explore the use of inexpensive wireless drifters as an alternative flexible infrastructure for fine-grained ocean monitoring. Surface drifters are designed specifically to move passively with the flow of water on the ocean surface and they are able to acquire sensor readings and GPS-generated positions at regular intervals. We view the fleet of drifters as a wireless ad-hoc sensor network with two types of nodes:i) a few powerful drifters with satellite connectivity, acting as mobile base-stations, and ii)a large number of low-power drifters with short-range acoustic or radio connectivity. Using real datasets from the Gulf of Maine (US) and the Liverpool Bay (UK), we study connectivity and uniformity properties of the ad-hoc mobile sensor network. We investigate the effect of deployment strategy, weather conditions as well as seasonal changes on the ability of drifters to relay readings to the end-users,and to provide sufficient sensing coverage of the monitored area. Our empirical study provides useful insights on how to design distributed routing and in-network processing algorithms tailored for ocean-monitoring sensor networks.},

In this paper, we propose a new simple and resource-aware key management scheme. The scheme is based on the idea that the initial pre-distributed key is not pre-loaded in all nodes to improve its resilience to node compromising attacks. Each node has to store an initial key, a set of prime number groups and a pseudo-random function. This pre-distributed secret information is used to establish pairwise keys between adjacent nodes after their deployment.

	Abstract = {The successful deployment of digital technologies by humanities scholars presents computer scientists with a number of unique scientific and technological challenges. The task seems particularly daunting because issues in the humanities are presented in abstract language demanding the kind of subtle interpretation often thought to be beyond the scope of artificial intelligence, and humanities scholars themselves often disagree about the structure of their disciplines. The future of humanities computing depends on having tools for automatically discovering complex semantic relationships among different parts of a corpus. Digital library tools for the humanities will need to be capable of dynamically tracking the introduction of new ideas and interpretations and applying them to older texts in ways that support the needs of scholars and students.
This paper describes the design of new algorithms and the adjustment of existing algorithms to support the automated and semi-automated management of domain-rich metadata for an established digital humanities project, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Our approach starts with a "hand-built" formal ontology that is modified and extended by a combination of automated and semi-automated methods, thus becoming a "dynamic ontology". We assess the suitability of current information retrieval and information extraction methods for the task of automatically maintaining the ontology. We describe a novel measure of term-relatedness that appears to be particularly helpful for predicting hierarchical relationships in the ontology. We believe that our project makes a further contribution to information science by being the first to harness the collaboration inherent in a expert-maintained dynamic reference work to the task of maintaining and verifying a formal ontology. We place special emphasis on the task of bringing domain expertise to bear on all phases of the development and deployment of the system, from the initial design of the software and ontology to its dynamic use in a fully operational digital reference work.},

	Abstract = {Building large scale systems involves many design decisions, both at specification and implementation levels. This is due to numerous variants in the description of the task to achieve and its execution context as well as in the assembly of software components. We have modeled variability for large scale systems using feature diagrams, a formalism well suited for modeling variablility. These models are built with a clear separation of concerns between specification and implementation aspects. They are used at design and deployment time as well as at execution time.
Our test application domain is video surveillance systems, from a software engineering perspective. These are good candidates to put model driven engineering to the test, because of the huge variability in both the surveillance tasks and the video analysis algorithms. They are also dynamically adaptive systems, thus suitable for models at run time approaches.
We propose techniques and tools to define the models, to operate on them, and to transform specification requirements into an effective implementation of a processing chain. We also define a run time architecture to integrate models into the adaptation loop.},

We present algorithms for efficiently detecting and updating Web pages affected after one or more fragments change. We also present algorithms for publishing sets of Web pages consistently; different algorithms are used depending upon the consistency requirements.Our publishing system provides an easy method for Web site designers to specify and modify inclusion relationships among Web pages and fragments. Users can update content on multiple Web pages by modifying a template. The system then automatically updates all Web pages affected by the change. Our system accommodates both content that must be proofread before publication and is typically from humans as well as content that has to be published immediately and is typically from automated feeds.We discuss some of our experiences with real deployments of our system as well as its performance. We also quantitatively present characteristics of fragments used at a major deployment of our publishing system including fragment sizes, update frequencies, and inclusion relationships.},

	Abstract = {The development of user interfaces (UIs) is one of the most time-consuming aspects in software development. In this context, the lack of proper reuse mechanisms for UIs is increasingly becoming manifest, especially as software development is more and more moving toward composite applications. In this paper we propose a framework for the integration of stand-alone modules or applications, where integration occurs at the presentation layer. Hence, the final goal is to reduce the effort required for UI development by maximizing reus.
The design of the framework is inspired by lessons learned from application integration, appropriately modified to account for the specificity of the UI integration problem. We provide an abstract component model to specify characteristics and behaviors of presentation components and propose an event-based composition model to specify the composition logic. Components and composition are described by means of a simple XML-based language, which is interpreted by a runtime middleware for the execution of the resulting composite application. A proof-of-concept prototype allows us to show that the proposed component model can also easily be applied to existing presentation components, built with different languages and/or component technologies.},

But when we consider the agricultural scenario in the Indian context, we realise that the ICT remains to be exploited to accrue its invaluable benefits. In recent times, the Government of India has introduced several initiatives to promote the application of ICT in agriculture sector. But when we compare the scale of ICT application in Indian agriculture sector with other developing countries like China, Brazil, etc., we find that application of ICT in Indian agriculture is yet to be applied on a significant magnitude. In this paper, we propose a cloud deployment model "Agri-Bridge", which provides access to agricultural market related information to farmers facing market connectivity constraints and acute capital shortage. Also, this model will operate as a bridge between the farmers and consumers within the existing agricultural produce marketing chain. This model utilizes the existing Government services, Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) databases, retail market sources besides leveraging cloud computing, mobile phone services and Internet services to provide a solution to the problem of lack of access to real-time market information to the farmers, hence modernising the Indian agricultural produce marketing system.},

Following Agile principles of software development is a natural choice. However, to truly leverage the power of Agile, big organizations need to be able to utilize distributed teams effectively. Agile relies hugely on shared context and awareness among team members and this can become a stumbling block among such geographically dispersed teams.

Here, we describe a gamification based approach which promotes quicker completion and acceptance of user stories in such distributed Agile projects. Our approach captures important events from the development environment and then helps create project-wide awareness regarding the progress of different teams. A model of earning revenue for faster delivery of user stories is used to determine the leading team at the end of each sprint.

	Abstract = {Component-based software structuring principles are now commonplace at the application level; but componentization is far less established when it comes to building low-level systems software. Although there have been pioneering efforts in applying componentization to systems-building, these efforts have tended to target specific application domains (e.g., embedded systems, operating systems, communications systems, programmable networking environments, or middleware platforms). They also tend to be targeted at specific deployment environments (e.g., standard personal computer (PC) environments, network processors, or microcontrollers). The disadvantage of this narrow targeting is that it fails to maximize the genericity and abstraction potential of the component approach. In this article, we argue for the benefits and feasibility of a generic yet tailorable approach to component-based systems-building that offers a uniform programming model that is applicable in a wide range of systems-oriented target domains and deployment environments. The component model, called OpenCom, is supported by a reflective runtime architecture that is itself built from components. After describing OpenCom and evaluating its performance and overhead characteristics, we present and evaluate two case studies of systems we have built using OpenCom technology, thus illustrating its benefits and its general applicability.},

In order to deal effectively with the complexity inherent in such ecosystems, future enterprises are anticipated to increasingly rely on cloud service brokerage (CSB). This paper presents a CSB mechanism which offers capabilities with respect to the Quality Assurance dimension of CSB. The proposed mechanism evaluates the compliance of cloud services with pre-specified policies concerning the technical, and mainly the business aspects, of service deployment and delivery. By relying on a declarative representation of both services and policies, the proposed mechanism is kept generic and orthogonal to any underlying cloud delivery platform.},

	Abstract = {In Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), the video bitrate is adapted to the network's condition based on client's feedback. Typically, a high bitrate is selected for next video chunk when the average of previously observed bandwidth samples is high and vice versa. An unexpected drop in the network throughput causes video freezing as the adaptation is done based on network's status in previous moment. In a vehicular environment, this problem is more likely to occur due to rapid movements of client to new locations where the network throughput can be very volatile. In this paper, we present a modified JavaScript DASH player that enables the streaming client to optimize the streaming performance by taking advantage of pre-collected bandwidth statistics in different locations. In this video player, Markov Decision Process (MDP) has been considered as the underlying optimization framework.},

@article{Morelli:2010:GCD:1859204.1859235,
	Abstract = {A firsthand account of an international team effort to install the Sahana disaster-management system in Chengdu, Sichuan after an earthquake.
On Monday May 12, 2008, an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale struck in Sichuan Province in southwestern China, destroying homes, schools, hospitals, roads, and vital power and communication infrastructure. More than 45 million people were affected---tens of thousands were killed, hundreds of thousands injured, millions of people were evacuated and left homeless, and millions of buildings were destroyed.
When the earthquake hit, several members of what became an international, volunteer, disaster-management IT team were attending a workshop in Washington, D.C. The workshop was organized by the IBM Office of Corporate Citizenship and Corporate Affairs department to train IBM personnel and others in the use and deployment of Sahana, a free and open source software (FOSS) disaster management system.
Sahana, which means relief in Sinhalese, is a Web-based collaboration tool that helps manage information resources during a disaster recovery effort. It supports a wide range of relief efforts from finding missing persons, to managing volunteers, tracking resources, and coordinating refugee camps. Sahana enables government groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the victims themselves to work together during a disaster recovery effort.
Over the next several weeks, the team members, distributed among several cities (Beijing and Chengdu in China, Hartford and New York in the U.S., and Colombo in Sri Lanka), worked together over global communication channels to configure and deploy Sahana in Chengdu, in order to support the disaster recovery effort there.
The organizations involved in the collaboration included:
* The Lanka Software Foundation (LSF), developers of the Sahana system. Three LSF members, led by the second author, were conducting the training workshop.
* Various departments of IBM, including Business Continuity and Resiliency Services. Ten employees led by the fourth author, who organized the workshop, were receiving instruction in how to deploy and use Sahana.
* The Humanitarian FOSS Project (H-FOSS), an NSF-funded effort aimed at revitalizing undergraduate computing education. Four students and their mentors, the first and third authors, were attending the workshop as developers and undergraduate members of the Sahana community.
* IBM China. Initially, local teams in Beijing and Chengdu consisting of corporate citizenship, government relations, and technical professionals led in demonstrating Sahana to local officials, securing buy-in, and establishing channels to proceed. Then a large team of developers, language specialists, and others, including a team based in Chengdu, Sichuan, eventually took charge of the deployment effort in Chengdu. The fifth author was a member of the China development team.
Almost immediately after the earthquake, discussions were held between IBM, IBM China, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Chengdu city government in Sichuan province. Once the Chengdu government expressed real interest in deploying Sahana, a team was formed to begin the process of localizing Sahana---that is, translating its user interface into simplified Chinese. The team was led by executives and software developers from IBM-China and assisted by Sahana team members in Colombo and student H-FOSS volunteers in Hartford.
The team's organizational structure followed the normal procedure involved in previous Sahana deployments---a local group in close proximity to the incident supported by volunteers from the global Sahana community. In this case IBM-China, including some who were directly affected by the disaster, took the lead in deploying Sahana over an intensive three-week period.
The decision by the Chengdu government to proceed with the deployment was taken on May 21, 2008 and a revised and localized version of Sahana was deployed in Chengdu on May 25. On June 12 we learned that 42 families had been reunited with the help of Sahana.
This article provides an inside look at the deployment effort. It describes how a diverse, multidisciplinary team---professional programmers, software engineers, executives from a large global enterprise, students, faculty, and humanitarian IT specialists from a global FOSS community---worked together to assist the earthquake recovery effort. The success of the collaboration illustrates the power of virtual communities working across international boundaries using a variety of electronic communication software. It also demonstrates that the Internet has truly made us all neighbors and is constantly forcing us to redefine our concept of community.},

	Abstract = {The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) emerges to be one of the key technologies to modernize object tracking and monitoring systems in indoor environments, e.g., airport baggage tracking. Although RFID has advantages over alternative identification technologies, the raw RFID data produced is inherently uncertain and contains errors. The dirty nature of raw RFID data hinders the progress of applying meaningful high-level applications that range from querying to analyzing. Therefore, cleansing RFID data is a high necessity. In this paper, we focus on handling one of the main aspects of raw RFID data, namely, false negatives, which occurs when a moving object passes the detection range of an RFID reader but the reader fails to produce any readings. We investigate the topology of indoor spaces as well as the deployment of RFID readers, and propose the transition probabilities that capture how likely objects move from one RFID reader to another. We organize such probabilities, together with the characteristics of indoor topology and RFID readers, into a probabilistic distance-aware graph model. Further, we evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of devised graph model in recovering the false negatives using real dataset. The experimental results show that the devised graph model is effective and efficient in handling false negatives in indoor RFID tracking data.},

	Abstract = {Management of cloud and cluster systems can be a daunting task, and becomes increasingly complicated as the organization grows and requires more computing resources. Organizations that have a need for a large amount of computing resources have two major deployment decisions: native cluster architecture or a local cloud based architecture. Regardless of the underlying architecture, the deployment process should remain universal. Many different deployment considerations are available. Automated deployment is desirable because typically these systems are headless, and thus difficult to manage individually. The tool, which we have developed allows users to deploy filesystem images on computer systems within the same local network. Additionally, the tool presents the user with node management tools for controlling the power state of the systems, as well as information such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, and power state.},

This paper describes a High Performance Computing (HPC) platform developed for these applications whilst also being flexible enough to accommodate new ones emerging from the gradual introduction of smart metering in the Low Voltage (LV) networks (AMI: Advanced Metering Infrastructures). Security and reliability requirements for both data and computations are very stringent. Our proposed architecture would allow the deployment of computations and data access as services, thus achieving independence on the actual hardware and software technologies deployed, and hardening against malicious as well as accidental corruptions. Cost containment and reliance on proven technologies are also of paramount importance to DNOs.

	Abstract = {The ubiquitous deployment of various kinds of sensors in smart cities requires a new computing paradigm to support Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications, and big data analysis. Fog Computing, which extends Cloud Computing to the edge of network, fits this need. In this paper, we present a hierarchical distributed Fog Computing architecture to support the integration of massive number of infrastructure components and services in future smart cities. To secure future communities, it is necessary to build large-scale, geospatial sensing networks, perform big data analysis, identify anomalous and hazardous events, and offer optimal responses in real-time. We analyze case studies using a smart pipeline monitoring system based on fiber optic sensors and sequential learning algorithms to detect events threatening pipeline safety. A working prototype was constructed to experimentally evaluate event detection performance of the recognition of 12 distinct events. These experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the system's city-wide implementation in the future.},

	Abstract = {The ACM DEBS Grand Challenge 2015 focuses on real-time analytics over a high volume geospatial data stream composed of taxi trip reports from New York City. The goal of the challenge is to provide a solution which continuously identifies the most frequent routes (query 1) and most profitable areas (query 2) for taxis in New York City. The solution needs to process the incoming data stream in near real-time to provide valid information about taxi positions to end-users in a real-world deployment. We propose a modular processing engine design which is configured to offer efficient performance with a high data throughput and low processing latency. It consists of three main components: an input processor which pre-processes data objects to detect outliers, and two independent query processors tailored to the requirements of challenge queries. To efficiently compute query results, query processors use algorithms customized to the distribution of the taxi-generated data stream. Our experimental evaluation shows that the system can on average process 350,000 input events per second in a distributed mode, while achieving an average latency of less than 1 ms for both queries. Due to their excellent performance, the proposed algorithms are well suited for efficient tracking of a large number of vehicles that are present in modern urban areas.},

	Abstract = {We present a long-term and cross-sectional study of a vibration-based water flow rate monitoring system in practical environments and scenarios. In our earlier research, we proved that a water flow monitoring system with vibration sensors is feasible by deploying and evaluating it in a small-scale laboratory setting. To validate the proposed system, the system was deployed in existing environments---two houses and a public restroom---and in two different laboratory test settings. With the collected data, we first demonstrate various aspects of the system's performance, including sensing stability, sensor node lifetime, the stability of autonomous sensor calibration, time to adaptation, and deployment complexity. We then discuss the practical challenges and lessons from the full-scale deployments. The evaluation results show that our water monitoring solution is a practical, quick-to-deploy system with a less than 5% average flow estimation error.},

PMIPv6 enables network-based mobility for a regular IPv6 mobile (MIPv6) with no mobility management protocol. But, there have been some issues identified with supporting a host with multiple interfaces attaching to the PMIPv6 domain. So we propose the method using NAT (Network Address Translation) in MAG (Mobile Access Gateway) which can continuously delivery packets although handover between heterogeneous access technologies occur. This paper analyzes the reduction of handover signaling cost in the proposed MAT (MAG Address Translation) method. It compares the handover signaling cost with PMIPv6 assisted by IEEE 802.21(MIH) and with the proposed method (i.e. PMIPv6-MAT) to show how much handover signaling cost reduction can be achieved.},

To minimize the unnecessary and repetitive implementation of identical functionalities for different platforms, we present our Global Sensor Networks (GSN) middleware which supports the flexible integration and discovery of sensor networks and sensor data, enables fast deployment and addition of new platforms, provides distributed querying, filtering, and combination of sensor data, and supports the dynamic adaption of the system configuration during operation. GSN's central concept is the virtual sensor abstraction which enables the user to declaratively specify XML-based deployment descriptors in combination with the possibility to integrate sensor network data through plain SQL queries over local and remote sensor data sources. In this demonstration, we specifically focus on the deployment aspects and allow users to dynamically reconfigure the running system, to add new sensor networks on the fly, and to monitor the effects of the changes via a graphical interface.

	Abstract = {Web service composition is a commonly used solution to build distributed systems on the cloud. Choreographies are one specific kind of service composition in which the responsibilities for the execution of the system are shared by its service components without a central point of coordination. Due to the distributed nature of these systems, a manual approach to resource usage monitoring and allocation to maintain the expected Quality of Service (QoS) is not only inefficient but also does not scale. In this paper, we present an open source choreography enactment middleware that is capable of automatically deploying and executing a composition. Additionally, it also monitors the composition execution to perform automatic resource provisioning and dynamic service reconfiguration based on pre-defined Service Level Agreement (SLA) constraints. To achieve that, it keeps a meta-level representation of the compositions, which contains their specifications, deployment statuses, and QoS attributes. Application developers can write specific rules that take into account these meta-data to reason about the performance of the composition and change its behavior. Our middleware was evaluated on Amazon EC2 and our results demonstrate that, with little effort from the choreography developer or deployer, the middleware is able to maintain the established SLA using both horizontal and vertical scaling when faced with varying levels of load. Additionally, it also reduces operational costs by using as little computational resources as possible.},

This problem is even greater with applications formed by the composition of multiple services. Cloud computing emerges as an alternative to provision of the needed resources, which is usually done using local infrastructure in conjunction with external providers. However, efficient resource management mechanisms and policies for offering quality services in these environments are necessary. This work is a PhD proposal, where is presented a middleware-based approach for cloud resources management and their provisioning according with non-funcional requirements and with greater usability by the deployer. Use of models at run-time and choreography of services for higher abstraction, adaptability and decentralization of the running system is proposed. Using this approach applications running in cloud environments may work based on their immediate needs.},

	Abstract = {The widespread diffusion of mobile computing calls for novel services capable of providing results that depend on both the current physical position of users (location) and the logical set of accessible resources, subscribed services, preferences, and requirements (context). Leaving the burden of location/context management to applications complicates service design and development. In addition, traditional middleware solutions tend to hide location/context visibility to the application level and are not suitable for supporting novel adaptive services for mobile computing scenarios. The article proposes a flexible middleware for the development and deployment of location/context-aware services for heterogeneous data access in the Internet. A primary design choice is to exploit a high-level policy framework to simplify the specification of services that the middleware dynamically adapts to the client location/context. In addition, the middleware adopts the mobile agent technology to effectively support autonomous, asynchronous, and local access to data resources, and is particularly suitable for temporarily disconnected clients. The article also presents the case study of a museum guide assistant service that provides visitors with location/context-dependent artistic data. The case study points out the flexibility and usability of the proposed middleware that permits automatic service reconfiguration with no impact on the implementation of the application logic.},

	Abstract = {Cloud computing is a recent computing paradigm that is changing software engineering. It offers scalable virtual compute resources at low prices, thus attracting many software developers interested in reducing their infrastructure and operational costs. Even though using cloud solutions is simple, with many providers and resource types available, a common difficulty developers face is how to best configure their applications using a myriad of cloud services, specially when considering different attributes such as cost, scalability, performance and others. A wrong architectural decision can lead to a significant cost increase or a deployment option that does not meet the minimum required performance. This work presents an approach that relies on non-functional requirements as key drivers for assessing and selecting, based on a multi-criteria optimization method, the best architectural options for deploying applications in the cloud. Results from a real application (WordPress) deployed in a popular cloud provider (Amazon) are discussed to illustrate the use and benefits of the approach.},

The proposed algorithm provides a metaheuristic-based approach for the multi-objective cloud-based software component deployment problem. MOACS-CoPeR explores the search-space of architecture design alternatives with respect to several architectural degrees of freedom and produces a set of Pareto-optimal deployment configurations. We also present a Java-based implementation of our proposed algorithm and compare its results with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). We evaluate the two algorithms against a cloud-based storage service, which is loosely based on a real system.},

We deployed LemonAid on 4 different web sites used by thousands of users and collected data over several weeks, gathering over 1,200 usage logs, 168 exit surveys, and 36 one-on-one interviews. Our results indicate that over 70% of users found LemonAid to be helpful, intuitive, and desirable for reuse. Software teams found LemonAid easy to integrate with their sites and found the analytics data aggregated by LemonAid a novel way of learning about users' popular questions. Our work provides the first holistic picture of the adoption and use of a crowdsourced contextual help system and offers several insights into the social and organizational dimensions of implementing such help systems for real-world applications.},

@article{Meixner:2012:NPD:2180796.2180812,
	Abstract = {In many areas of human life, computer-based Information Technology (IT) has prevailed and become essential for the coordinated and efficient organization of workflows. Especially in the field of health care, interaction between human beings and IT is a sensitive subject. Inevitably, people working in the field of health care will have to make use of the potentials of IT in order to meet the enormous demands on e.g. patient management. When we look at the situation of current medical software systems, we can find major advances in the performance capacities of modern software systems, but must also note their rapid penetration into almost every facet of the daily hospital routine. Today medical software systems can be characterized as a vast number of (networked) software which each fulfills specific functions (e.g., hospital information system, Picture Archiving and Communication System) and which is used by different user groups (e.g., physicians, nurses, medical secretaries) with diverse user tasks [4]. Yet, for almost two decades, graphical user interfaces have dominated the interaction of medical software systems in most cases. In the future, a broader range of paradigms will emerge, allowing for multi-modal interaction. But also the growing number of heterogeneous platforms (operating systems, graphical libraries) and devices utilized complementarily (e.g., PC, Toughbook, Smartphone, PDA) demand for the development of congeneric user interfaces for a plethora of target platforms. Especially "mobile healthcare computing devices (MHCDs) are rapidly becoming an integral part of hospital information systems. Deployment of these devices is becoming an important IT strategy designed to assist in improving quality of care, enhancing patient services, increasing productivity, lowering costs, improving cash flow, as well as facilitating other critical delivery processes" [3]. For MHCDs aspects like getting the right information at the right time in the right place (context sensitivity) is important.
To be able to cope with requirements like interoperability, context-sensitivity and device-independent usage a model-based approach for the development of user interfaces (MBUID) appears to be favourable [2].},

	Abstract = {The current approach used to obtain official television channel statistics is based on polls combined with specialized reporting hardware. These are deployed only on a small scale and batch processed every 24~hours. With the enhanced capabilities of present-day IPTV set-top-boxes, network operators can track channel popularity and usage patterns with a degree of precision and sophistication not possible with existing methods. One such network operator, Altibox, is the largest provider of IPTV in Norway with a deployment of over 320,000 set top-boxes. By tapping into the high-volume stream of channel zap events sent from these set-top boxes, very accurate viewership can be obtained and presented in near real-time.
In this paper, we examine two programming paradigms for implementing applications to compute viewership based on channel zap events. One based on a general-purpose programming language (Java) and the other based on a highly specialized event stream processing language (EPL). An important characteristic of this application is stateful event processing. We are interested in exploring the trade-offs between these two implementations, to determine their suitability for such applications. Specifically, we are interested in the performance trade-off and the program complexity of each implementation.
Our results show that a pure Java implementation has a significant edge over EPL in terms of performance. Although, our numbers cannot be used to draw a general conclusion, it seems indicative that an event stream processing engine would suffer more than a general-purpose language as query complexity grows. We conjecture that this is because it is easier to construct custom data structures for the specific problem in a general-purpose language like Java. In terms of program complexity, EPL has a slight edge in all metrics, and a significant edge when event streams can be reused to perform more complex processing, indicating that less effort is necessary to extend functionality.},

	Abstract = {A release is a collection of authorized software changes that include new functionality, changed functionality, or both, that are introduced into the production environment. Agile software development results in many small releases delivered as needed, as opposed to big-bang releases that deploy large amounts of functionality at regularly determined intervals. Agile software development without a detailed standard process model encompassing the overall release management activity can result in an emergent release schedule (which is almost as bad as not having one), potential bottlenecks for resources, and problems handling genuine emergency releases. Changes to software systems must occur in a disciplined and controlled way. Otherwise lack of control over the delivered changes will lead to deteriorated system quality. Change Management is often in conflict with Agile in that Change Management requires a big, heavy, schedule, dates, content, and deployment resources specified well in advance. This is a major attraction of big-bang releases; that their deployments seem to be easier to manage. In a fast changing Agile environment the survival of the software organization may be affected. There is no reason to abandon Agile development for the sake of a disciplined and controlled release process. Our proposed pattern language captures the expertise necessary to create an orderly, well thought out, end-to-end release management process that should help deliver software releases in a disciplined and controlled way within an Agile development environment.},

We review these challenges and how they relate to scientific computing. To achieve the portability, interoperability, and economies of scale that clouds offer, it is clear that common design principles must be widely adopted in both the user community and marketplace. To this end, we argue that a private-to-public cloud deployment trajectory will be very common, if not dominant. This trajectory can be used to define a progression of needed common practices and standards which, in turn, can be used to define deployment, development and fundamental research agendas. We then survey the cloud standards landscape and how the standards process could be driven by major stakeholders, e.g., large user groups, vendors, and governments, to achieve scientific and national objectives. We conclude with a call to action for stakeholders to actively engage in driving this process to a successful conclusion.},

	Abstract = {Data Warehouse (DW) systems maintain sensitive and crucial information, which is integrated from various heterogenous sources of organization. With the ever increasing deployment and usage of networks, these systems are becoming more vulnerable to malicious attacks. With the increased number of attacks, intrusion detection has become vital part of Information Security. In this paper, we have proposed a model for analyzing and detecting anomalous events based on user behavior analysis through usage patterns, user profiles and session management. After monitoring the events in the system, if any intrusion activity occurs, then alerts are issued to system administrators. Since a user profile is not necessarily fixed but rather it evolves with changing time, so a dynamic user behavior modeling is represented as a sequence of events and combination of fact and dimension tables accessed by the users. In this way, DW systems may be protected by the malicious attacks.},

	Abstract = {Today's rapidly evolving network ecosystem, characterized by increasing traffic volumes, service heterogeneity and mutating cyber-threats, calls for new approaches to packet processing to address key issues such as scalability, flexibility, programmability and fast deployment. To this aim, this paper explores a new direction to packet processing by pushing forward functional programming principles in the definition of a ''software defined networking'' paradigm.
This result is achieved by introducing PFQ-Lang, an extensible functional language which can be used to process, analyze and forward packets captured on modern multi-queue NICs (for example, it allows to quickly develop the early stage of monitoring applications). An implementation of PFQ-Lang, embedded into high level programming languages as an eDSL (embedded Domain Specific Language) is also presented. The proposed approach allows an easy development by leveraging the intuitive functional composition and, at the same time, allows to exploit multi-queue NICs and multi-core architectures to process high-speed network traffic. Experimental results are provided to prove that the presented implementation reaches line rate performance on a 10Gb line card. To demonstrate the effectiveness and expressiveness of PFQ-Lang, the paper also presents a few use-cases ranging from forwarding, firewalling and monitoring of real traffic.},

These systems tend to afford asynchronous push interactions, and within the context of health, provide medication reminders, descriptions of symptoms and tips on self-management. Here, we present the development of an IVR system for resource-limited settings that enables real-time, synchronous interaction. Inspired by community radio, and calls for health systems that are truly local, we developed "Sehat ki Vaani". Sehat ki Vaani is a real-time IVR platform that enables hosting and participation in radio chat shows on community-led topics. We deployed Sehat ki Vaani with two communities in North India on topics related to the management of Type 2 diabetes and maternal health. Our deployments highlight the potential for synchronous IVR systems to offer community connection and localised sharing of experience, while also highlighting the complexity of producing, hosting and participating in radio shows in real time through IVR. We discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of synchronous IVR systems, and highlight lessons learnt for interaction design in this area.},

	Abstract = {Global Software Development (GSD) teams encounter challenges that are associated with distribution of software development activities across multiple geographic regions. The limited support for performing collaborative development and engineering activities and lack of sufficient support for maintaining and resolving dependencies and traceability across heterogeneous tools are major challenges for GSD teams. The lack of insufficient support for cross platform tools integration also makes it hard to address the stated challenges using existing paradigms that are based upon desktop and web-based solutions. The restricted ability of the organizations to have desired alignment of tools with software engineering and development processes results in administrative and managerial overhead that incur increased development cost and poor product quality. Moreover, stakeholders involved in the projects have specific constraints regarding availability and deployments of the tools. The artifacts and data produced or consumed by the tools need to be governed according to the constraints and corresponding quality of service (QoS) parameters. In this paper, we present the research agenda to leverage cloud-computing paradigm for addressing above-mentioned issues by providing a framework to select appropriate tools as well as associated services and reference architecture of the cloud-enabled middleware platform that allows on demand provisioning of software engineering Tools as a Service (TaaS) with focus on integration of tools.},

The independence between datacenters, however, prohibits effective inter-datacenter resource sharing and flexible management of the infrastructure. In this paper, we propose WL2, a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) solution to an Internet-scale Layer-2 network across multiple datacenters. In WL2, a logically centralized controller handles control-plane communication and configuration in each datacenter. We achieve scalability in three ways: (1) eliminating Layer-2 broadcast by rerouting control-plane traffic to the controller; (2) introducing a layered addressing scheme for aggregate Layer-2 routing; and (3) creating an overlay abstraction on top of physical topology for fast flow setup. WL2 is fault-tolerant against controller and gateway failures. We deployed and evaluated WL2 in a 2,250-VM testbed across three datacenters. The results indicate high performance and robustness of the system.},

One important component missing from this analysis workflow is data management that allows efficient and flexible data retrieval, (ease of) reproducibility, and the (ease of) techniques reuse on user-defined data subsets or other data.
In this paper, we describe our preliminary investigation on the utilization of the distributed array-based database management system, SciDB, to support data-driven climate science research. We focus on modeling and generating indices that allow effective execution of various spatiotemporal queries on satellite data. Moreover, we demonstrate fast and accurate data retrieval based on user-specified trajectories from the SciDB database containing tropical cyclone trajectories and the complete ten-year QuikSCAT ocean surface wind fields satellite data.
Our preliminary work indicates the feasibility of the array-based technology for multiple satellite data storage, query, and analysis. Towards this end, a successful deployment of SciDB-based data storage can facilitate the use of data from multiple satellites for climate and weather research.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a security architecture for the basic cross indexing systems emerging as foundational structures in current health information systems. In these systems unique identifiers are issued to healthcare providers and consumers. In most cases, such numbering schemes are national in scope and must therefore necessarily be used via an indexing system to identify records contained in pre-existing local, regional or national health information systems. Most large scale electronic health record systems envisage that such correlation between national healthcare identifiers and pre-existing identifiers will be performed by some centrally administered cross referencing, or index system. This paper is concerned with the security architecture for such indexing servers and the manner in which they interface with pre-existing health systems (including both workstations and servers). The paper proposes two required structures to achieve the goal of a national scale, and secure exchange of electronic health information, including: (a) the employment of high trust computer systems to perform an indexing function, and (b) the development and deployment of an appropriate high trust interface module, a Healthcare Interface Processor (HIP), to be integrated into the connected workstations or servers of healthcare service providers. This proposed architecture is specifically oriented toward requirements identified in the Connectivity Architecture for Australia's e-health scheme as outlined by NEHTA and the national e-health strategy released by the Australian Health Ministers.},

An assurance argument for security (i.e., a security argument) provides comprehensive documentation of all evidence and rationales for justifying belief in a security claim about a software system.

	Abstract = {Deploying components of a service-oriented system in a network of machines is often a complex and labourious process. Usually the environment in which such systems are deployed is dynamic: any machine in the network may crash, network links may temporarily fail, and so on. Such events may render the system partially or completely unusable. If an event occurs, it is difficult and expensive to redeploy the system to the take the new circumstances into account. In this paper we present a self-adaptive deployment framework built on top of Disnix, a model-driven distributed deployment tool for service-oriented systems. This framework dynamically discovers machines in the network and generates a mapping of components to machines based on non-functional properties. Disnix is then invoked to automatically, reliably and efficiently redeploy the system.},

	Abstract = {The demand for quickly delivering new applications is increasingly becoming a business imperative today. Application development is often done in an ad hoc manner, without standard frameworks or libraries, thus resulting in poor reuse of software assets. Web services have received much interest in industry due to their potential in facilitating seamless business-to-business or enterprise application integration. A web services composition tool can help automate the process, from creating business process functionality, to developing executable workflows, to deploying them on an execution environment. However, we find that the main approaches taken thus far to standardize and compose web services are piecemeal and insufficient. The business world has adopted a (distributed) programming approach in which web service instances are described using WSDL, composed into flows with a language like BPEL and invoked with the SOAP protocol. Academia has propounded the AI approach of formally representing web service capabilities in ontologies, and reasoning about their composition using goal-oriented inferencing techniques from planning. We present the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the above approaches. We describe a prototype service creation environment along with a use-case scenario, and demonstrate how it can significantly speed up the time-to-market for new services.},

	Abstract = {The use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software can greatly reduce the development cost and effort for complex software systems. Reusing software can also improve the general quality of a system by leveraging already proven implementations. One of the limiting factors in the adoption of COTS software is the complexity of integrating it with the rest of the system under development. Often, requirements do not entirely match the functionalities available in COTS components, increasing the complexity of the glue software that needs to be written. In this paper, we present the blueprint of a service-oriented architecture that can guide the engineer both in specifying the functionalities of a complex software system and as a deployment architecture to seamlessly integrate COTS components implementing such functionalities. The COTS integration concern, typically a deployment issue, is addressed in the service architecture, and is treated as first-class citizen of the development process.},

Real-time elaborations of a large amount of information and knowledge are needed to automate control and decision making processes. In this scenario raw data are captured and processed through a chain of activities (filtering, fusion, classification) generating abstract information that is selected, diffused and presented to interested users. These activities can be turned into the interpretation of executable transformation models, abstract representations of input-output transformations which can be coded on a calculator. Executable transformation models might not be static; but they may be dynamically generated by observing and processing incoming data. From the architectural point of view the dynamic model generation implies the existence of mechanisms for the dynamic deployment of the executable transformation models. In this paper we present a software architecture aimed at providing these mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Amid today's proliferation of Web content and mobile phones with broadband data access, interacting with small-form factor devices is still cumbersome. Spoken interaction could overcome the input limitations of mobile devices, but running an automatic speech recognizer with the limited computational capabilities of a mobile device becomes an impossible challenge when large vocabularies for speech recognition must often be updated with dynamic content. One popular option is to move the speech processing resources into the network by concentrating the heavy computation load onto server farms. Although successful services have exploited this approach, it is unclear how such a model can be generalized to a large range of mobile applications and how to scale it for large deployments. To address these challenges we introduce the AT&T speech mashup architecture, a novel approach to speech services that leverages web services and cloud computing to make it easier to combine web content and speech processing. We show that this new compositional method is suitable for integrating automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis resources into real multimodal mobile services. The generality of this method allows researchers and speech practitioners to explore a countless variety of mobile multimodal services with a finer grain of control and richer multimedia interfaces. Moreover, we demonstrate that the speech mashup is scalable and particularly optimized to minimize round trips in the mobile network, reducing latency for better user experience.},

The network between the client and server is, in most cases, the main cause for latency and out of the scope of the game's developer. But the developer should avoid introducing unnecessary delays within his responsibility; i.e. with respect to development and operating costs he should wisely choose a network stack and deployment model for the server in order to reduce latency. In this paper we present latency measurements of the Linux network stack and effects of virtualization. We show that a worst-case scenario can cause a latency in the millisecond range when running a game server. We discuss how latencies can be reduced by using the packet processing framework DPDK to replace the operating system's network stack.},

However, in the world of big data, these systems are struggling to cope with overload and often become the bottle neck in the data network. To overcome this, our research investigates the use of deploying intrusion-detection and intrusion-prediction techniques in a cloud environment. Consequently, in this paper, a survey of existing intrusion-detection systems is presented and a discussion on how their deployment can enhance current security techniques in a cloud computing environment is put forward. A novel technique for intrusion prediction system is also put forward in this paper. Predictive statistical methods are used for proving the concepts put forward. The initial results show the necessity for using evolving statistical methods in prediction solutions; and the insufficiency of 'single-technique models' for building general solutions to predict intrusions. Furthermore, as this research shows, the concept of integrating multiple methods, such as game theory concepts and risk assessment methods, facilitates the development of a more efficient prediction model.},

	Abstract = {The links between the software architecture and the source code of a software system should be based on solid traceability mechanisms in order to effectively perform quality control and maintenance of the software system. There are several primary studies on traceability between software architecture and source code but so far no systematic literature review (SLR) has been undertaken. This study presents an SLR which has been carried out to discover the existing traceability approaches and tools between software architecture and source code, as well as the empirical evidence for these approaches, their benefits and liabilities, their relations to software architecture understanding, and issues, barriers, and challenges of the approaches. In our SLR the ACM Guide to Computing Literature has been electronically searched to accumulate the biggest share of relevant scientific bibliographic citations from the major publishers in computing. The search strategy identified 742 citations, out of which 11 have been included in our study, dated from 1999 to July, 2013, after applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our SLR resulted in the identification of the current state-of-the-art of traceability approaches and tools between software architecture and source code, as well as gaps and pointers for further research. Moreover, the classification scheme developed in this paper can serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners to find a specific approach or set of approaches that is of interest to them.},

	Abstract = {In modern environment, delivering innovative idea in a fast and reliable manner is extremely significant for any organizations. In the existing scenario, Insurance industry need to better respond to dynamic market requirements, faster time to market for new initiatives and services, and support innovative ways of customer interaction. In past few years, the transition to cloud platforms has given benefits such as agility, scalability, and lower capital costs but the application lifecycle management practices are slow with this disruptive change. DevOps culture extends the agile methodology to rapidly create applications and deliver them across environment in automated manner to improve performance and quality assurance. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous delivery (CD) has emerged as a boon for traditional application development and release management practices to provide the capability to release quality artifacts continuously to customers with continuously integrated feedback. The objective of the paper is to create a proof of concept for designing an effective framework for continuous integration, continuous testing, and continuous delivery to automate the source code compilation, code analysis, test execution, packaging, infrastructure provisioning, deployment, and notifications using build pipeline concept.},

	Abstract = {As part of Agile transformation in past few years we have seen IT organizations adopting continuous integration principles in their software delivery lifecycle, which has improved the efficiency of development teams. With the time it has been realized that this optimization as part of continuous integration - alone - is just not helping to make the entire delivery lifecycle efficient or is not driving the organization efficiency. Unless all the pieces of a software delivery lifecycle work like a well oiled machine - efficiency of organization to optimize the delivery lifecycle can not be met. This is the problem which DevOps tries to address. This paper tries to cover all aspects of Devops applicable to various phases of SDLC and specifically talks about business need, ways to move from continuous integration to continuous delivery and its benefits. Continuous delivery transformation in this paper is explained with a real life case study that how infrastructure can be maintained just in form of code (IAAC). Finally this paper touches upon various considerations one must evaluate before adopting DevOps and what kind of benefits one can expect.},

	Abstract = {Static analysis tools are used for improving software quality and reliability. Since these tools can be time consuming when used for analysis of big codebases, they are normally run during scheduled (e.g. nightly) builds. However, the sooner a defect is found, the easier it is to fix efficiently. In order to detect defects faster, some analysis tools offer an integration with the integrated development environment of the developers at the cost of not always detecting all the issues. To detect defects earlier and still provide a reliable solution, one could think of running an analysis tool at every build of a continuous integration system. In this paper, we share the lessons learned during the integration of the static analysis tool Klocwork (that we are developing) with our continuous integration system. We think that the lessons learned will be beneficial for most companies developing safety-critical software (or less critical systems) that wish to run their analysis tool more often in their build system. We report these lessons learned along with examples of our successes and failures.},

The generic open software architecture for avionics system similar to Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) is therefore proposed. In this architecture, the portability of components is allowed through standardized interfaces between components and the software computing environment, which consists of an operating system, transport services and I/O services. The conformance test (CT) for the portable components should be automatically executed to support continuous integration. This paper presents a portal component conformance test environment (PCCTE) in which CT tasks are scheduled using event-driven policies based on a continuous integration server (such as Jenkins), and are executed in the cloud environment based on container (suck as Docker & Kubernetes) and micro-services (such as ZooKeeper). As a result, the evaluation shows that PCCTE is workable and effective.},

	Abstract = {The enterprises follow Agile Software Development methodology to because business requirements changes frequently. In Agile Software Development methodology, it is essential to continuously integrate the component into a main trunk of a project to test the new component of the system. Then test all the component of the project; this happens frequently so it needs to stream line processes to orchestrate the tests. So it is difficult to manage the software development life cycle for those changes and maintain the software code quality. To maintain the product quality it is essential to integrate the product component and need to deploy a product on pre-production environment and test the product. Hence the need for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery process for software product. The popularization of DevOps, and cloud computing has revolutionized the software delivery process- making it faster and affordable for business to release their software continuously. Hence Enterprises need for reliable and predictable delivery process of software. The objective of the paper is to design an effective framework for automated testing and deployment to help to automate the code analysis, test selection, test scheduling, environment provisioning, test execution, results analysis and deployment pipeline. Test orchestration framework typically very complicated to develop such pipeline to make software reliable, and bug free.

The main conclusion to be drawn from previous experience of hardware-software systems production was to make changes in software development process. In particular, integration practice was set up as independent process with special build-engineer to maintain it. During the stage-by-stage evolution of integration process a number of key factors have been revealed: cross-platform development, component inter dependency, lack of human and time resources. To meet all requirements several integration schemes have been proposed and put into operation. On the basis of previous projects in-depth analysis the decision on introducing into practice continuous integration and automated build processes was made. The set of measures intended to integration process development which was presented in this paper allows us to reduce time cost on software releases from several days to several hours. Furthermore, suggested scheme of integration process is considered to be universal and, therefore, could be applied in any project regardless of operating systems which are used in development process. At the same time it should be noted that for the purpose of most successful implantation of continuous integration it is essential that all process stages should be well documented and understood by all developers before project starts.},

	Abstract = {Continuous Delivery is an agile software development practice in which developers frequently integrate changes into the main development line and produce releases of their software. An automated Continuous Integration infrastructure builds and tests these changes. Claimed advantages of CD include early discovery of (integration) errors, reduced cycle time, and better adoption of coding standards and guidelines. This paper reports on a study in which we surveyed 152 developers of a large financial organization (ING Nederland), and investigated how they adopt a Continuous Integration and delivery pipeline during their development activities. In our study, we focus on topics related to managing technical debt, as well as test automation practices. The survey results shed light on the adoption of some agile methods in practice, and sometimes confirm, while in other cases, confute common wisdom and results obtained in other studies. For example, we found that refactoring tends to be performed together with other development activities, technical debt is almost always "self-admitted", developers timely document source code, and assure the quality of their product through extensive automated testing, with a third of respondents dedicating more than 50% of their time to do testing activities.},

We consider a real-life scenario, how the software development is carried out in corporate ventures and how Jenkins can save developers/integrators crucial work hours by automating the complete process. In this paper, Jenkins is implemented in a master/slave architecture where master node is the Jenkins server and slaves are the Jenkins clients. We discuss the usage of various plug-ins available that allow Jenkins to be used with any environment of software development.},

	Abstract = {Context: Software companies seek to gain benefit from agile development approaches in order to meet evolving market needs without losing their innovative edge. Agile practices emphasize frequent releases with the help of an automated toolchain from code to delivery. Objective: We investigate, which tools are used in software delivery, what are the reasons omitting certain parts of the toolchain and what implications toolchains have on how rapidly software gets delivered to customers. Method: We present a multiple-case study of the toolchains currently in use in Finnish software-intensive organizations interested in improving their delivery frequency. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews in 18 case organizations from various software domains. The interviewees were key representatives of their organization, considering delivery activities. Results: Commodity tools, such as version control and continuous integration, were used in almost every organization. Modestly used tools, such as UI testing and performance testing, were more distinctly missing from some organizations. Uncommon tools, such as artifact repository and acceptance testing, were used only in a minority of the organizations. Tool usage is affected by the state of current workflows, manual work and relevancy of tools. Organizations whose toolchains were more automated and contained fewer manual steps were able to deploy software more rapidly. Conclusions: There is variety in the need for tool support in different development steps as there are domain-specific differences in the goals of the case organizations. Still, a well-founded toolchain supports speedy delivery of new software.},

	Abstract = {Context
Testing complex industrial robots (CIRs) requires testing several interacting control systems. This is challenging, especially for robots performing process-intensive tasks such as painting or gluing, since their dedicated process control systems can be loosely coupled with the robot's motion control.
Objective
Current practices for validating CIRs involve manual test case design and execution. To reduce testing costs and improve quality assurance, a trend is to automate the generation of test cases. Our work aims to define a cost-effective automated testing technique to validate CIR control systems in an industrial context.
Method
This paper reports on a methodology, developed at ABB Robotics in collaboration with SIMULA, for the fully automated testing of CIRs control systems. Our approach draws on continuous integration principles and well-established constraint-based testing techniques. It is based on a novel constraint-based model for automatically generating test sequences where test sequences are both generated and executed as part of a continuous integration process.
Results
By performing a detailed analysis of experimental results over a simplified version of our constraint model, we determine the most appropriate parameterization of the operational version of the constraint model. This version is now being deployed at ABB Robotics's CIR testing facilities and used on a permanent basis. This paper presents the empirical results obtained when automatically generating test sequences for CIRs at ABB Robotics. In a real industrial setting, the results show that our methodology is not only able to detect reintroduced known faults, but also to spot completely new faults.
Conclusion
Our empirical evaluation shows that constraint-based testing is appropriate for automatically generating test sequences for CIRs and can be faithfully deployed in an industrial context.},

Currently stable, beta and alpha releases of MDSplus are maintained for eleven different platforms including Windows, MacOSX, RedHat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Ubuntu and Solaris. For some of these platforms, MDSplus packaging has been broken into functional modules so users can pick and choose which MDSplus features they want to install. An added feature to the latest Linux based platforms is the use of package dependencies. When installing MDSplus from the package repositories, any additional required packages used by MDSplus will be installed automatically greatly simplifying the installation of MDSplus.

	Abstract = {Recent software engineering paradigms such as software product lines, supporting development techniques like feature modeling, and cloud provisioning models such as platform and infrastructure as a service, allow for great flexibility during both software design and deployment, resulting in potentially large cost savings. However, all this flexibility comes with a catch: as the combinatorial complexity of optional design features and deployment variability increases, the difficulty of assessing system qualities such as scalability and quality of service increases too. And if the software itself is not scalable (for instance, because of a specific set of selected features), deploying additional service instances is a futile endeavor. Clearly there is a need to systematically measure the impact of feature selection on scalability, as the potential cost savings can be completely mitigated by the risk of having a system that is unable to meet service demand. In this work, we document our results on systematic load testing for automated quality of service and scalability analysis. The major contribution of our work is tool support and a methodology to analyze the scalability of these distributed, feature oriented multi-tenant software systems in a continuous integration process. We discuss our approach to select features for load testing such that a representative set of feature combinations is used to elicit valuable information on the performance impact and feature interactions. Additionally, we highlight how our methodology and framework for performance and scalability prediction differs from state-of-practice solutions. We take the viewpoint of both the tenant of the service and the service provider, and report on our experiences applying the approach to an industrial use case in the domain of electronic payments. We conclude that the integration of systematic scalability tests in a continuous integration process offers strong advantages to software developers and service providers, such as the ability to quantify the impact of new features in existing service compositions, and the early detection of hidden feature interactions that may negatively affect the overall performance of multi-tenant services.},

	Abstract = {An explosion of digital multimedia technologies that permit quick and easy uploading of any multimedia file to the web, coupled with the rapid advancement of hardware and software have resulted in petabytes of multimedia data being available on the internet. In this paper, we provide a framework that rapidly integrates these data for personalized storyboarding utilizing Content Based Multimedia Retrieval (CBMR) techniques. A storyboard is a narrative of audio, text, video and images of a particular topic that are linked systematically. People have different abilities to understand a story/topic according to their learning styles coupled with experience, age, knowledge, gender etc. Personalized storyboard multimedia learning help the user dictate the learning process in a creative way through multiple means of representation, expression and engagement. This process involves active learning, both behavioral as well as cognitive. Learning is constructive, and information learned is remembered at a deeper level. The use of multimedia promotes meaningful learning that can be transferred or generalized to other situations. In this paper, various learning styles are discussed. The goal of the research was to design and implement a novel approach that integrates human reasoning with computerized algorithms for multimedia storyboarding for learning. By systematically coupling human reasoning and computerized process, we attempt to minimize the barrier between the human's cognitive model of what they are trying to storyboard and the computers understanding of the user's task. We present our model which utilizes a fusion of content based image retrieval, content based video retrieval, content based audio retrieval, and text based retrieval techniques with human computer interaction based relevance feedback to enhance the learning process through personalized multimedia storyboarding. To illustrate the advantages of this model in a greater detail, we showcased the concepts of this model utilizing the game of cricket. We summarize the paper by discussing the future in this area.},

While this is an ostensibly simple concept, it does leave ample room for interpretation: what is it the developers integrate with, what happens when they do, and what happens before they do? These are all open questions with regards to the details of how one implements the practice of continuous integration, and it is conceivable that not all such implementations in the industry are alike. In this paper we show through a literature review that there are differences in how the practice of continuous integration is interpreted and implemented from case to case. Based on these findings we propose a descriptive model for documenting and thereby better understanding implementations of the continuous integration practice and their differences. The application of the model to an industry software development project is then described in an illustrative case study.},

	Abstract = {The research in this paper combines two main areas, the first one is software quality and the second is the agile practices of continuous integration. Software quality has been an important topic since the beginning of the software development and production. Many researches have been conducted to discuss how the quality of software is a critical factor to its success [1--5]. Because software became an important part of almost every task in our daily life, having high quality software that meets the users' expectations is important [6]. Software integration is a stage in every software development lifecycle, it is defined as the process to assemble the software components and produce a single product. It has been shown that software integration and integration testing can make more than 40% of the overall project cost, so it is important that they are done efficiently and easily to be able to manage the involved risks [7]. A software engineering practice called continuous integration (CI) was introduced by Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries to mitigate the risks of software integration, enhance its process and improve its quality [8]. In this research, the principles of CI are identified and applied to a case study in order to analyze their impact on the software development process quality factors.},

However, a complex 2D curve flower pattern can be easily acquired or drawn by handcraft or a drawing software. This paper presents a quick integrative 3D modeling method of complex carving surface based on a 2D curve flower pattern. The proposed method uses a scanning analysis algorithm, a normal distribution function and a distance function to model and create carving tracks. In this paper, the delamination, combination and interpolation of modelling process are described as well. The provided research method will make the modelling of complex carving surface more intelligent, agile, and will meet the requirement of integrative 3D modelling of digital art carving. Experimental results show that this method is of quick modelling and multi-model effective characteristics with realizable interactive designing and excellent practicability.},

	Abstract = {While viewing works of art in galleries, we evaluate them by integrating at least two types of information: their visual properties (e.g., colors, symmetry, and proportion) and contextual information accompanying them (e.g., titles and names of artists). How rapidly the brain integrates visual and contextual information of artworks remains to be investigated. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated neural activity when subjects with no professional experience in art viewed images of sculptures (masterpieces from the Classical and Renaissance periods, characterized by a canonical proportion of the golden ratio) and performed a five-scale rating of how appealing they were. At the beginning of each trial, we manipulated the expectations of the subjects for an upcoming sculpture by presenting information about its authenticity (either ``genuine'' or ``fake''), although all images were actually taken from genuine artworks. The image of the sculpture was then presented, either in its original proportion or after being deformed by a photo-editing software. This 2 × 2 factorial design enabled us to identify whether each component of the EEG response was sensitive to contextual information (genuine or fake), visual information (original or deformed), or both. Results revealed that amplitudes of a positive EEG component emerging at 200--300ms after the presentation of the artworks (mainly distributed over the parietal cortex) were significantly modulated by both visual and contextual factors, indicating a rapid integration of these two types of information in the brain.},

	Abstract = {Currently, there is a plethora of low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware available for implementing control systems. These range from devices with fairly low intelligence, e.g. smart sensors and actuators, to dedicated controllers such as PowerPC, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and PC-based boards to dedicated systems-on-a-chip (SoC) ASICS and FPGAs. When considering the construction of complex distributed systems, e.g. for a ship, aircraft, car, train, process plant, the ability to rapidly integrate a variety of devices from different manufacturers is essential. A problem, however, is that manufacturers prefer to supply proprietary tools for programming their products. As a consequence of this lack of `openness', rapid prototyping and development of distributed systems is extremely difficult and costly for a systems integrator. Great opportunities thus exist to produce high-performance, dependable distributed systems. However, the key element that is missing is software tool support for systems integration. The objective of the Flexible Control Systems Development and Integration Environment for Control Systems (FLEXICON) project IST-2001-37269 is to solve these problems for industry and reduce development and implementation costs for distributed control systems by providing an integrated suite of tools to support all the development life-cycle of the system. Work within the Rolls-Royce supported University Technology Centre (UTC) is investigating rapid prototyping of controllers for aero-engines, unmanned aerial vehicles and ships. This paper describes the use of the developed co-simulation environment for a high-speed merchant vessel propulsion system application.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a novel ambient intelligence (AmI) platform is proposed to facilitate fast integration of different control algorithms, device networks and user interfaces. This platform defines the overall hardware/software architecture and communication standards. It consists of four layers, namely the ubiquitous environment, middleware, multi-agent system and application layer. The multi-agent system is implemented using Java Agent DEvelopment (JADE) framework and allows users to incorporate multiple control algorithms as agents for managing different tasks. The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) device discovery protocol is used as a middleware, which isolates the multi-agent system and physical ubiquitous environment while providing a standard communication channel between the two. An XML content language has been designed to provide standard communication between various user interfaces and the multi-agent system. A mobile ubiquitous setup box is designed to allow fast construction of ubiquitous environments in any physical space. The real time performance analysis shows the potential of the proposed AmI platform to be used in real-life AmI applications. A case study has also been carried out to demonstrate the possibility of integrating multiple control algorithms in the multi-agent system and achieving a significant improvement on the overall offline learning performance.},

	Abstract = {The Environmental Units Map (EUM) is a strategic document that provides valuable information about landscape attributes for studies focused on environmental research, urban and land planning and environmental management. Traditionally, the systematic mapping of landforms has been used to integrate landforms and environmental data. Widespread availability of remote sensing data along with thematic cartography and implementation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), allows a fast integration of landscape environmental attributes, effectively reducing time and costs. In this study we propose an approach to delineate an environmental units map using a geomorphologic map and a multivariate analysis processed in a GIS on a regional cartographic scale (1:75,000). Our study area is La Malinche volcano (located in central M{\'e}xico) where there are highly contrasting biophysical conditions and land use over relatively short distances. By means of a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) a total of 29 environmental units were obtained for La Malinche. The environmental units range from alpine environments to semi arid lowlands (over a wide volcanic piedmont) where crops and urban development predominate. Our results suggest that integrating environmental units using a multivariate statistical approach not only produces results in agreement with what we observe empirically, but it also allows us to identify those factors which control the grouping of environmental attributes. The method proposed here can be used to integrate environmental data in a single map, and this could prove useful for environmental management in the future.},

However, the textual content of patents presents obstacles to gleaning useful information. In this study, we develop an expert system framework that utilizes text and data mining procedures for analyzing innovation through textual patent data. Specifically, we use patent titles representing the innovation activity at one company (SAP) and perform a bibliometric analysis using our proposed framework. Enterprise software, of which SAP is a pioneering developer, must serve a wide assortment of functions for companies in many different industries. In addition, SAP's sole focus is on enterprise software and it is a market leader in the category with substantial patent activity over the last decade. Using our framework to analyze SAP's patent activity provides a demonstration of how our bibliometric analysis can summarize and identify trends in innovation in a large software company. Our results illustrate that SAP has a breadth of innovative activity spread over the three-tier software engineering architecture and a lack of topical repetition indicative of limited depth. SAP's innovation is also seen to emphasize data management and quickly integrate emerging technologies. Results of an analysis on any company following our framework could be used for a variety of purposes, including: to examine the scope and scale of innovation of an organization, to examine the influence of technological trends on businesses, or to gain insight into corporate strategy that could be used to aid planning, investment, and purchasing decisions.},

	Abstract = {On the way to the fourth industrial revolution, one major requirement lies in reaching interoperability between hardware and software systems. Especially real-time propagation of shop floor information in top-level production planning and control systems as well as the consolidation of distributed information into a consistent data basis for comprehensive data analysis are still missing in most production environments. Existing approaches to serve interoperability through standardized interfaces are limited by proprietary data exchange protocols and information models. Within industrial manufacturing and automation, standardization attempts between these systems are primarily focused on industrial interfaces like OPC/OPC-UA. However, the aggregation of data created by devices like sensors or machinery control units into useful information has not been satisfactorily solved yet as their underlying models are carried out using different modeling paradigms and programming languages, thus intercommunication is difficult to implement and to maintain. In this work, an integration chain for data from field level to top-level information systems is presented. As Manufacturing Execution Systems or Enterprise Resource Planning tools are implemented in higher programming languages, the modeling of field level information has to be adapted in terms of a semantic interpretation. The approach provides integration capabilities for OPC-conform data generated on the field level. The information is extracted from low level information systems, transformed according to object-oriented programming paradigms and object-relational standards and finally integrated into databases that allow full semantic annotation and interpretation compatible to a common information model. Hence, users on management levels of the enterprise are able to perform holistic data treatment and data exploration along with personalized information views based on this central data storage by means of a reliable and comfortable data acquisition. This increases the quality of data and of the decision support itself, as more time remains for the actual task of data evaluation.},

	Abstract = {Short development times that are characterized by a high return on engineering (RoE) become increasingly important as a critical success factor for the realization of radical innovation. However, the high degree of complexity of modern products results in a long and costly development time when traditional sequential development processes are employed. The paper at hand describes the restraints of typical gate-oriented product development processes and builds up on recent studies recommending highly iterative innovation processes for the fast realization of physical product ideas. The suggested methodology represents an approach based on the Scrum process model from the software industry that includes the continuous integration of costumers and production engineers based on the execution of feasibility studies by the early and stepwise development of prototypes. In this context, modern ramp up and demonstration factories possessing a product lifecycle management (PLM) system, an integrated ICT infrastructure, interdisciplinary engineering teams and scalable manufacturing technologies are suggested as key enablers. The authors illustrate that these facilities, together with a sensor-based product expedition are particularly suitable for implementing an adapted Scrum process for the development of physical product ideas. A critical reflection on the basis of the development of an electric car aims to underline the suitability of the presented methodology in enabling radical innovation},

	Abstract = {The rapid integration of physical systems with cyberspace infrastructure, the so-called Internet of Things, is likely to have a significant effect on how people interact with the physical environment and design information and communication systems. Internet-connected systems are expected to vastly outnumber people on the planet in the near future, leading to grand challenges in software engineering and automation in application domains involving complex and evolving systems. Several decades of artificial intelligence research suggests that conventional approaches to making such systems automatically interoperable using handcrafted ``semantic'' descriptions of services and information are difficult to apply. In this paper we outline a bioinspired learning approach to creating interoperable systems, which does not require handcrafted semantic descriptions and rules. Instead, the idea is that a functioning system (of systems) can emerge from an initial pseudorandom state through learning from examples, provided that each component conforms to a set of information coding rules. We combine a binary vector symbolic architecture (VSA) with an associative memory known as sparse distributed memory (SDM) to model context-dependent prediction by learning from examples. We present simulation results demonstrating that the proposed architecture can enable system interoperability by learning, for example by human demonstration.},

Recent years have seen an increasing interest in general theories of software engineering. As in other academic fields, these theories aim to explain and predict the key phenomena of the discipline.
Objective
The present article proposes a general theory of software engineering that we have labeled the Tarpit theory, in reference to the 1982 epigram by Alan Perlis.
Method
An integrative theory development approach was employed to develop the Tarpit theory from four underlying theoretical fields: (i) languages and automata, (ii) cognitive architecture, (iii) problem solving, and (iv) organization structure. Its applicability was explored in three test cases.
Results
The theory demonstrates an explanatory and predictive potential for a diverse set of software engineering phenomena. It demonstrates a capability of explaining Brooks's law, of making predictions about domain-specific languages, and of evaluating the pros and cons of the practice of continuous integration.
Conclusion
The presented theory appears capable of explaining and predicting a wide range of software engineering phenomena. Further refinement and application of the theory remains as future work.},

	Abstract = {In the emerging world of information technologies, a growing number of students is choosing this specialization for their education. Therefore, the number of homework and laboratory research assignments that should be tested is also growing. The majority of these tasks is based on the necessity to implement some algorithm as a small program. This article discusses the possible solutions to the problem of automated testing of programming laboratory research assignments. The course ``Algorithmization and Programming of Solutions'' is offered to all the first-year students of The Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (∼500 students) in Riga Technical University and it provides the students the basics of the algorithmization of computing processes and the technology of program design using Java programming language (the given course and the University will be considered as an example of the implementation of the automated testing). During the course eight laboratory research assignments are planned, where the student has to develop an algorithm, create a program and submit it to the education portal of the University. The VBA test program was designed as one of the solutions, the requirements for each laboratory assignment were determined and the special tests have been created. At some point, however, the VBA offered options were no longer able to meet the requirements, therefore the activities on identifying the requirements for the automation of the whole cycle of programming work reception, testing and evaluation have begun.},

	Abstract = {Context
While there are many success stories of achieving high reuse and improved quality using software platforms, there is a need to investigate the issues and challenges organizations face when transitioning to a software platform strategy.
Objective
This case study provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the challenges faced when a medium-scale organization decided to adopt software platforms. The study also reveals how new trends in software engineering (i.e. agile methods, distributed development, and flat management structures) interplayed with the chosen platform strategy.
Method
We used an ethnographic approach to collect data by spending time at a medium-scale company in Scandinavia. We conducted 16in-depth interviews with representatives of eight different teams, three of which were working on three separate platforms. The collected data was analyzed using Grounded Theory.
Results
The findings identify four classes of challenges, namely: business challenges, organizational challenges, technical challenges, and people challenges. The article explains how these findings can be used to help researchers and practitioners identify practical solutions and required tool support.
Conclusion
The organization's decision to adopt a software platform strategy introduced a number of challenges. These challenges need to be understood and addressed in order to reap the benefits of reuse. Researchers need to further investigate issues such as supportive organizational structures for platform development, the role of agile methods in software platforms, tool support for testing and continuous integration in the platform context, and reuse recommendation systems.},

	Abstract = {The modeling of bioreactors with immobilized cells is a complex process, incorporating in itself different complex operations. Depending on the design of the bioreactor and the biotechnological process are possible different combinations of mathematical models. Knowledge of the kinetics of biological processes and mass transfer are necessary to understand the basic principle of operation of the bioreactor. An important step in developing a complete model of the bioreactor is to explore and describe the flows' structure in the working volume of the apparatus. For reactors with different flow and mixing characteristics are needed different methods for design, modeling and scaling-up. In this work an analysis of the experimental curves to determine the liquid residence time distribution (RTD) of liquid in the bioreactor was made. Based on this analysis, two different combined models of the flow structures were built. The study was done using specialized software RTD 3.14. The estimation of the models parameter was made using least square method. The algorithm permits parallel, serial and other kinds of connections of building blocks, including recycles. Directions of flows between blocks and flow fractions, when necessary, are set by user. The models are characterized with simple structure and with good ability to reproduce experimental results with high accuracy. They were built by plug flow and ideal mixing units, which is a prerequisite for easy and quick integration in the synthesis model of the fermentation process in the bioreactor. The developed combined models for RTD description will be used to establish a system for control of the ethanol fermentation with immobilized cells. Thus, the impact of flow hydrodynamics will be render in account on the fermentation process.},

	Abstract = {Huge magnetic clouds of plasma emitted by the Sun dominate intense geomagnetic storm occurrences and simultaneously they are correlated with variations of spectra of particles and nuclei in the interplanetary space, ranging from subtermal solar wind ions till GeV energy galactic cosmic rays. For a reliable and fast forecast of Space Weather world-wide networks of particle detectors are operated at different latitudes, longitudes, and altitudes. Based on a new type of hybrid particle detector developed in the context of the International Heliophysical Year (IHY 2007) at Aragats Space Environmental Center (ASEC) we start to prepare hardware and software for the first sites of Space Environmental Viewing and Analysis Network (SEVAN). In the paper the architecture of the newly developed data acquisition system for SEVAN is presented. We plan to run the SEVAN network under one-and-the-same data acquisition system, enabling fast integration of data for on-line analysis of Solar Flare Events. An Advanced Data Acquisition System (ADAS) is designed as a distributed network of uniform components connected by Web Services. Its main component is Unified Readout and Control Server (URCS) which controls the underlying electronics by means of detector specific drivers and makes a preliminary analysis of the on-line data. The lower level components of URCS are implemented in C and a fast binary representation is used for the data exchange with electronics. However, after preprocessing, the data are converted to a self-describing hybrid XML/Binary format. To achieve better reliability all URCS are running on embedded computers without disk and fans to avoid the limited lifetime of moving mechanical parts. The data storage is carried out by means of high performance servers working in parallel to provide data security. These servers are periodically inquiring the data from all URCS and storing it in a MySQL database. The implementation of the control interface is based on high level web standards and, therefore, all properties of the system can be remotely managed and monitored by the operators using web browsers. The advanced data acquisition system at ASEC in Armenia was started in November, 2006. The reliability of the multi-client service was proven by continuously monitoring neutral and charged cosmic ray particles. Seven particle monitors are located at 2000 and 3200m above sea level at a distance of 40 and 60km from the main data server.},

	Abstract = {Context
Developing a theory of agile technology, in combination with empirical work, must include assessing its performance effects, and whether all or some of its key ingredients account for any performance advantage over traditional methods. Given the focus on teamwork, is the agile technology what really matters, or do general team factors, such as cohesion, primarily account for a team's success? Perhaps the more specific software engineering team factors, for example the agile development method's collective ownership and code management, are decisive.
Objective
To assess the contribution of agile methodology, agile-specific team methods, and general team factors in the performance of software teams.
Method
We studied 40 small-scale software development teams which used Extreme Programming (XP). We measured (1) the teams' adherence to XP methods, (2) their use of XP-specific team practices, and (3) standard team attributes, as well as the quality of the project's outcomes. We used Williams et al.'s (2004a) [33] Shodan measures of XP methods, and regression analysis.
Results
All three types of variables are associated with the project's performance. Teamworking is important but it is the XP-specific team factor (continuous integration, coding standards, and collective code ownership) that is significant. Only customer planning (release planning/planning game, customer access, short releases, and stand-up meeting) is positively related to performance. A negative relationship between foundations (automated unit tests, customer acceptance tests, test-first design, pair programming, and refactoring) is found and is moderated by craftsmanship (sustainable pace, simple design, and metaphor/system of names). Of the general team factors only cooperation is related to performance. Cooperation mediates the relationship between the XP-specific team factor and performance.
Conclusion
Client and team foci of the XP method are its critical active ingredients.},

	Abstract = {Objectives
Our study goals were to evaluate the 3-dimensional matrix array transesophageal echocardiographic (3D-MTEE) probe by assessing the image quality of native valves and other intracardiac structures.
Background
Because 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography with gated rotational acquisition is not used routinely as the result of artifacts, lengthy acquisition, and processing, a 3D-MTEE probe was developed (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, Massachusetts).
Methods
In 211 patients, 3D-MTEE zoom images of the mitral valve (MV), aortic valve, tricuspid valve, interatrial septum, and left atrial appendage were obtained, followed by a left ventricular wide-angled acquisition. Images were reviewed and graded off-line (Xcelera with QLAB software, Philips Medical Systems).
Results
Excellent visualization of the MV (85% to 91% for all scallops of both MV leaflets), interatrial septum (84%), left atrial appendage (86%), and left ventricle (77%) was observed. Native aortic and tricuspid valves were optimally visualized only in 18% and 11% of patients, respectively.
Conclusions
The use of 3D-MTEE imaging, which is feasible in most patients, provides superb imaging of native MVs, which makes this modality an excellent choice for MV surgical planning and guidance of percutaneous interventions. Optimal aortic and tricuspid valve imaging will depend on further technological developments. Fast acquisition and immediate online display will facilitate wider acceptance and routine use in clinical practice.},

	Abstract = {Policy makers have a growing interest in integrated assessments of policies. The Integrated Assessment Modelling (IAM) community is reacting to this interest by extending the application of model development from pure scientific analysis towards application in decision making or policy context by giving tools a higher capability for analysis targeted at non-experts, but intelligent users. Many parties are involved in the construction of such tools including modellers, domain experts and tool users, resulting in as many views on the proposed tool. During tool development research continues which leads to advanced understanding of the system and may alter early specifications. Accumulation of changes to the initial design obscures the design, usually vastly increasing the number of defects in the software. The software engineering community uses concepts, methods and practices to deal with ambiguous specifications, changing requirements and incompletely conceived visions, and to design and develop maintainable/extensible quality software. The aim of this paper is to introduce modellers to software engineering concepts and methods which have the potential to improve model and tool development using experiences from the development of the Sustainability Impact Assessment Tool. These range from choosing a software development methodology for planning activities and coordinating people, technical design principles impacting maintainability, quality and reusability of the software to prototyping and user involvement. It is argued that adaptive development methods seem to best fit research projects, that typically have unclear upfront and changing requirements. The break-down of a system into elements that overlap as little as possible in features and behaviour helps to divide the work across teams and to achieve a modular and flexible system. However, this must be accompanied by proper automated testing methods and automated continuous integration of the elements. Prototypes, screen sketches and mock-ups are useful to align the different views, build a shared vision of required functionality and to match expectations.},
