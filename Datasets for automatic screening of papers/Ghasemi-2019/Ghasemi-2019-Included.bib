	Abstract = {The management of business processes in modern times is rapidly shifting towards being evidence-based. Business process evaluation indicators tend to focus on process performance only, neglecting the definition of indicators to evaluate other concerns of interest in different phases of the business process lifecycle. Moreover, they usually do not discuss specifically which data must be collected to calculate indicators and whether collecting these data is feasible or not. This paper proposes a business process assessment framework focused on the process redesign lifecycle phase and tightly coupled with process mining as an operational framework to calculate indicators. The framework includes process performance indicators and indicators to assess whether process redesign best practices have been applied and to what extent. Both sets of indicators can be calculated using standard process mining functionality. This, implicitly, also defines what data must be collected during process execution to enable their calculation. The framework is evaluated through case studies and a thorough comparison against other approaches in the literature.},

	Abstract = {Process mining is not only about discovery and conformance checking of business processes. It is also focused on enhancing processes to improve the business performance. While from a business perspective this third main stream is definitely as important as the others if not even more, little research work has been conducted. The existing body of work on process enhancement mainly focuses on ensuring that the process model is adapted to incorporate behavior that is observed in reality. It is less focused on improving the performance of the process. This paper reports on a methodology that creates an enhanced model with an improved performance level. The enhancements of the model limit incorporated behavior to only those parts that do not violate any business rules. Finally, the enhanced model is kept as close to the original model as possible. The practical relevance and feasibility of the methodology is assessed through two case studies. The result shows that the process models improved through our methodology, in comparison with state-of the art techniques, have improved KPI levels while still adhering to the desired prescriptive model.},

	Abstract = {The evaluation of an organization's performance may also consider the assessment of inter-organizational relationships (IORs). However, the evaluation of IORs is typically based on success factors, such as trust, which are difficult to be measured quantitatively. In this paper, we present a framework supporting inter-organizational performance evaluation which integrates (i) a bottom-up approach supporting the identification of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from business information, event logs, as well as process models, and (ii) a top-down approach for measuring business performance on the strategic level based on the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method. In order to prove the feasibility of the framework, we present an inter-organizational performance analysis case study of a beverage manufacturing company. The case study shows that the framework enables (i) the derivation of quantifiable KPIs from operational data and (ii) the alignment of KPIs with business objectives allowing an evaluation of IORs on the strategic level.},

	Abstract = {Inter-organizational relationships (IORs) are important for creating business potential and increasing business performance. The evaluation of IORs is necessary for analyzing the collaboration between businesses as well as for assessing business partners. However, the evaluation of IORs is ambiguous since it is usually measured by success factors, such as trust and information sharing, which are difficult to be measured quantitatively. In this paper, we propose using quantifiable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for measuring success factors. We aim to identify KPIs in inter-organizational scenarios where information is exchanged electronically based on EDIFACT message types. In particular, we i) derive inter-organizational KPIs and propose guidelines for their calculation from EDIFACT data elements, and ii) aggregate these KPIs to define quantitative measurements reflecting inter-organizational success factors. Therefore, we first define a method for the systematic selection of suitable data elements from EDIFACT message types based on frequency analysis. Second, we consider the semantics of data elements and message types in defining KPIs. Having these KPIs at hand supports the quantitative evaluation of success factors which in turn enables the evaluation of IORs.},

	Abstract = {Intentions play a key role in information systems engineering. Research on process modeling has highlighted that specifying intentions can expressly mitigate many problems encountered in process modeling as lack of flexibility or adaptation. Process mining approaches mine processes in terms of tasks and branching. To identify and formalize intentions from event logs, this work presents a novel approach of process mining, called Map Miner Method (MMM). This method automates the construction of intentional process models from event logs. First, MMM estimates users' strategies (i.e., the different ways to fulfill the intentions) in terms of their activities. These estimated strategies are then used to infer users' intentions at different levels of abstraction using two tailored algorithms. MMM constructs intentional process models with respect to the Map metamodel formalism. MMM is applied on a real-world dataset, i.e. event logs of developers of Eclipse UDC (Usage Data Collector). The resulting Map process model provides a precious understanding of the processes followed by the developers, and also provide feedback on the effectiveness and demonstrate scalability of MMM.},

Several support and guidance solutions based on process mining have been proposed, but they lack a suitable semantics for human reasoning and decisions making as they mainly rely on low level activities. Applying design science, we created FlexPAISSeer, an intention mining oriented approach, with its component artifacts: 1) IntentMiner which discovers the intentional model of the executable process in an unsupervised manner; 2) IntentRecommender which generates recommendations as intentions and confidence factors, based on the mined intentional process model and probabilistic calculus. The artifacts were evaluated in a case study with a Netherlands software company, using a Childcare system that allows flexible data-driven process enactment.},

	Abstract = {Learning humans' behavior from activity logs requires choosing an adequate machine learning technique regarding the situation at hand. This choice impacts significantly results reliability. In this paper, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to build intentional process models (Maps) from activity logs. Since HMMs parameters require to be learned, the main contribution of this paper is to compare supervised and unsupervised learning approaches of HMMs. After a theoretical comparison of both approaches, they are applied on two controlled experiments to compare the Maps thereby obtained. The results demonstrate using supervised learning leads to a poor performance because it imposes binding conditions in terms of data labeling, introduces inherent humans' biases, provides unreliable results in the absence of ground truth, etc. Instead, unsupervised learning obtains efficient Maps with a higher performance and lower humans' effort.},

This paper presents a novel approach, so-called Map Miner Method (MMM), designed to automate the construction of intentional process models from process logs. To do so, MMM uses Hidden Markov Models to model users' activities logs in terms of users' strategies. MMM also infers users' intentions and constructs fine-grained and coarse-grained intentional process models with respect to the Map metamodel syntax (i.e., metamodel that specifies intentions and strategies of process actors). These models are obtained by optimizing a new precision-fitness metric. The result is a software engineering method process specification aligned with state of the art of method engineering approaches. As a case study, the MMM is used to mine the intentional process associated to the Eclipse platform usage. Observations show that the obtained intentional process model offers a new understanding of software processes, and could readily be used for recommender systems.},

	Abstract = {Understanding people's goals is a challenging issue that is met in many different areas such as security, sales, information retrieval, etc. Intention Mining aims at uncovering intentions from observations of actual activities. While most Intention Mining techniques proposed so far focus on mining individual intentions to analyze web engine queries, this paper proposes a generic technique to mine intentions from activity traces. The proposed technique relies on supervised learning and generates intentional models specified with the Map formalism. The originality of the contribution lies in the demonstration that it is actually possible to reverse engineer the underlying intentional plans built by people when in action, and specify them in models e.g. with intentions at different levels, dependencies, links with other concepts, etc. After an introduction on intention mining, the paper presents the Supervised Map Miner Method and reports two controlled experiments that were undertaken to evaluate precision, recall and F-Score. The results are promising since the authors were able to find the intentions underlying the activities as well as the corresponding map process model with satisfying accuracy, efficiency and performance.},

	Abstract = {Since several decades, discovering process models is a subject of interest in the Information System (IS) community. Approaches have been proposed to recover process models, based on the recorded sequential tasks (traces) done by IS's actors. However, these approaches only focused on activities and the process models identified are, in consequence, activity-oriented. Intentional process models focus on the intentions underlying activities rather than activities, in order to offer a better guidance through the processes. Unfortunately, the existing process-mining approaches do not take into account the hidden aspect of the intentions behind the recorded user activities. We think that we can discover the intentional process models underlying user activities by using Intention mining techniques. The aim of this paper is to propose the use of probabilistic models to evaluate the most likely intentions behind traces of activities, namely Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We focus on this paper on a supervised approach that allows discovering the intentions behind the user activities traces and to compare them to the prescribed intentional process model.},

However, the expert-designed clinical pathways can hardly deal with the variances among hospitals and patients. It calls for more dynamic and adaptive process, which is derived from various clinical data. Topic-based clinical pathway mining is an effective approach to discover a concise process model. Through this approach, the latent topics found by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) represent the clinical goals. And process mining methods are used to extract the temporal relations between these topics. However, the topic quality is usually not desirable due to the low performance of the LDA in clinical data. In this paper, we incorporate topic assignment constraint and topic correlation limitation into the LDA to enhance the ability of discovering high-quality topics. Two real-world datasets are used to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the topics discovered by our method are with higher coherence, informativeness, and coverage than the original LDA. These quality topics are suitable to represent the clinical goals. Also, we illustrate that our method is effective in generating a comprehensive topic-based clinical pathway model.},

	Abstract = {Software systems are designed to support their users in performing tasks that are parts of more general processes. Unfortunately, software designers often make invalid assumptions about the users' processes and therefore about the requirements to support such processes. Eliciting and validating such assumptions through manual means (e.g., through observations, interviews, and workshops) is expensive, time-consuming, and may fail to identify the users' real processes. Using process mining may reduce these problems by automating the monitoring and discovery of the actual processes followed by a crowd of users. The Crowd provides an opportunity to involve diverse groups of users to interact with a system and conduct their intended processes. This implicit feedback in the form of discovered processes can then be used to modify the existing system's functionalities and ensure whether or not a software product is used as initially designed. In addition, the analysis of user-system interactions may reveal lacking functionalities and quality issues. These ideas are illustrated on the GreenSoft personal energy management system.},

A goal model can be viewed as a composition of a number of goal refinement patterns that relate parent goals to subgoals. In this paper, we offer a means for mining these patterns from enterprise event logs and a technique to leverage vector representations of words and phrases to compose these patterns to obtain complete goal models. The resulting machinery can be quiote powerful in its ability to mine know-how or constitutive norms. We offer an empirical evaluation using both real-life and synthetic datasets.},

	Abstract = {Customer Journey Mapping (CJM), is an emerging area of research tackling issues related to customer behavior and user trajectories when consuming a service. The increasing complexity of the service in- dustry makes this type of tools popular amongst practitioners. However, to date, it is not clear how a CJM can be used to depict hundreds or thousands of customer journeys. Inspired by process discovery techniques -- borrowed from Process Mining -- we present CJM-explorer (CJM-ex). CJM-ex is a web interface that uses hierarchical clustering and statistical indexes to allow interactive navigation, with or without a-priori informa- tion, through numerous journeys stored in standard event log formats. The exploration of the underlying journeys can be done in the whole set of data available or driven by user goals in order to examine events and patterns in specific areas of interest.

	Abstract = {Business process work-arounds are specific forms of incompliant behavior, where employees intentionally decide to deviate from the required procedures although they are aware of them. Detecting and understanding the work-arounds performed can guide organizations in redesigning and improving their processes and support systems. Existing process mining techniques for compliance checking and diagnosis of incompliant behavior rely on the available information in event logs and emphasize technological capabilities for analyzing this information. They do not distinguish intentional incompliance and do not address the sources of this behavior. In contrast, the paper builds on a list of generic types of work-arounds found in practice and explores whether and how they can be detected by process mining techniques. Results obtained for four work-around types in five real-life processes are reported. The remaining two types are not reflected in events logs and cannot be currently detected by process mining. The detected work-around data are further analyzed for identifying correlations between the frequency of specific work-around types and properties of the processes and of specific activities. The analysis results promote the understanding of work-around situations and sources.},

	Abstract = {Discovering and reasoning about deviations of business process executions (from intended designs) enables organizations to continuously evaluate their execution/performance relative to their strategic goals. We leverage the observation that a deviating process instance can be viewed as a valid variant of the intended process design provided it achieves the same goals as the intended process design. However, organizations often find it difficult to categorize and classify process execution deviations in a goal-based fashion (necessary to decide if a deviation represents a valid variant). Given that industry-scale knowledge-intensive processes typically manifest a large number of variants, this can pose a problem. In this paper, we propose an approach to help decide whether process instances in execution logs are valid variants using the goal-based notion of validity described above. Our proposed approach also enables analysis of the impact of contextual factors in the execution of specific goal-aligned process variants. We demonstrate our approach with an Eclipse-based plugin and evaluate it using an industry-scale setting in IT Incident Management with a process log of 25000 events.},

	Abstract = {Constructing a business process is important area between requirements engineering and business process management. Goal-oriented requirements analysis method is widely researched in requirements engineering and useful for reflecting organizational requirements to business process models, but actual business processes deviate from defined process models. Therefore, it is not sufficient for business process analysis only using model's information. It is important to analyze actual conducted business process logged data. Analyzing business process logged data is called process mining and detecting differences between models and logs is called conformance checking. A lot of conformance checking approaches mainly focus on process aspects of business process, but this is not sufficient for analysis whether actual business processes can satisfy organizational goals. In this paper, we propose a goal-oriented conformance checking approach which can detect deviations between logs and models, and can analyze the effects of the deviation. It is useful for evaluation of the detected deviation. We represent the effectiveness of our approach conducting a case study using the publicly available log.},

@article{Yan:2014,
	Abstract = {When designing a business process, individual agents are assigned to perform tasks based on certain goals (i.e., designed process goals). However, based on their own interests, real-world agents often have different goals (i.e., agents' goals) and thus may behave differently than designed, often resulting in reduced effectiveness or efficiencies of the executed process. Moreover, existing business process research lacks effective methods for discovering agents' goals in the actual execution of the designed business processes. To address this problem, we propose an agent-oriented goal mining approach to modeling, discovering, and analyzing agents' goals in executed business processes using historical event logs and domain data. To the best of our knowledge, our research is the first to adopt the agents' goal perspective to study inconsistencies between the design and execution of business processes. Moreover, it also provides a useful tool for stakeholders to discover real-world agents' actual goals and thus provides insights for improving the task assignment mechanism or business process design in general.},

The automatic recognition of the goal that motivates an employee to execute a particular sequence of tasks is crucial to determine what tasks are expected to be performed next in order to achieve that goal within the dynamics of the organization. Furthermore, an early recognition of the employee's goal can also prevent deviations in his/her behavior from the expected behavior by providing personalized assistance. In this article we propose a model to capture regularities in the activities carried out by employees of an organization when they are pursuing different goals. An experimental evaluation was conducted in order to determine the validity of our approach and promising results are reported.},

	Abstract = {Because of the rapid changes in the market environment and the uncertain demands from the customers, the investment in the information system by the corporate is increasing. This also resulted in the adoption of the process management system, which is intended for the adaptation to the speed of such changes, creation of competitiveness, and systematic management of the business process. To process the service demands from the customers that come in a dynamic manner, an analysis on the possible scope of changes on the recognition of the problems will be required, as well as the concept of data mining to redesign the process based on the adaptive decisions. The existing workflow mining technology was designed to extract business process redesign information from simple database fields or create a process model by collecting, identifying, and analyzing log information from the system that it could not be dynamically reconfigured by exploring the process flow suitable for new requests made on business process. In this study, an analytical method will be suggested using a heuristic algorithm based on the goals to create an adaptive process mining model that could provide a continuous service demand scenario that is created dynamically.},
