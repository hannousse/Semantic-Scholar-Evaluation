	Abstract = {This paper describes an algorithm to detect user's mental chunks by analysis of pause lengths in goal-directed human-computer interaction. Identifying and characterizing users' chunks can help in gauging the users' level of expertise. The algorithm described in this paper works with information collected by an automatic logging mechanism. Therefore, it is applicable to situations in which no human intervention is required to perform the analysis, such as adaptive interfaces. An empirical study was conducted to validate the algorithm, showing that mental chunks and their characteristics can indeed be inferred from analysis of human-computer interaction logs. Users performing a variety of goal-directed tasks were monitored. Using an automated logging tool, every command invoked, every operation performed with the input devices, as well as all system responses were recorded. Analysis of the interaction logs was performed by a program that implements a chunk detection algorithm that looks at command sequences and timings. The results support the hypothesis that a significant number of user mental chunks can be detected by our algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and programmable interconnects have made it possible to build efficient hardware emulation engines. In addition, improvements in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools, mainly in synthesis tools, greatly simplify the design of large circuits. The RPM (Rapid Prototype Engine for Multiprocessors) Project leverages these two technological advances. Its goal is to develop a common hardware platform for the emulation of multiprocessor systems with different architectures.
For cost reasons, the use of FPGAs in RPM is limited to the memory controllers, while the rest of the emulator, including the processors, memories and interconnect, is built with off-the-shelf components. A flexible non-intrusive event logging mechanism is included at all levels of the memory hierarchy, making it possible to monitor the emulation in very fine detail. This paper presents the hardware design of RPM.},

@inproceedings{Hudson:1999:TCP:320719.322590,
	Abstract = {A central goal of many user interface development tools has been to make the construction of high quality interfaces easy enough that iterative design approaches could be a practical reality. In the last 15 years significant advances in this regard have been achieved. However, the evaluation portion of the iterative design process has received relatively little support from tools. Even though advances have also been made in usability evaluation methods, nearly all evaluation is still done ``by hand,'' making it more expensive and difficult than it might be. This paper considers a partial implementation of the CRITIQUE usability evaluation tool that is being developed to help remedy this situation by automating a number of evaluation tasks. This paper will consider techniques used by the system to produce predictive models (keystroke level models and simplified GOMS models) from demonstrations of sample tasks in a fraction of the time needed by conventional handcrafting methods. A preliminary comparison of automatically generated models with models created by an expert modeler show them to produce very similar predictions (within 2%). Further, because they are automated, these models promise to be less subject to human error and less affected by the skill of the modeler.},

@inproceedings{Sahoo:2003:CEP:956750.956799,
	Abstract = {As the complexity of distributed computing systems increases, systems management tasks require significantly higher levels of automation; examples include diagnosis and prediction based on real-time streams of computer events, setting alarms, and performing continuous monitoring. The core of autonomic computing, a recently proposed initiative towards next-generation IT-systems capable of 'self-healing', is the ability to analyze data in real-time and to predict potential problems. The goal is to avoid catastrophic failures through prompt execution of remedial actions.This paper describes an attempt to build a proactive prediction and control system for large clusters. We collected event logs containing various system reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) events, and system activity reports (SARs) from a 350-node cluster system for a period of one year. The 'raw' system health measurements contain a great deal of redundant event data, which is either repetitive in nature or misaligned with respect to time. We applied a filtering technique and modeled the data into a set of primary and derived variables. These variables used probabilistic networks for establishing event correlations through prediction algorithms. We also evaluated the role of time-series methods, rule-based classification algorithms and Bayesian network models in event prediction.Based on historical data, our results suggest that it is feasible to predict system performance parameters (SARs) with a high degree of accuracy using time-series models. Rule-based classification techniques can be used to extract machine-event signatures to predict critical events with up to 70% accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Automated, rapid, and effective fault management is a central goal of large operational IP networks. Today's networks suffer from a wide and volatile set of failure modes, where the underlying fault proves difficult to detect and localize, thereby delaying repair. One of the main challenges stems from operational reality: IP routing and the underlying optical fiber plant are typically described by disparate data models and housed in distinct network management systems. We introduce a fault-localization methodology based on the use of risk models and an associated troubleshooting system, SCORE (Spatial Correlation Engine), which automatically identifies likely root causes across layers. In particular, we apply SCORE to the problem of localizing link failures in IP and optical networks. In experiments conducted on a tier-1 ISP backbone, SCORE proved remarkably effective at localizing optical link failures using only IP-layer event logs. Moreover, SCORE was often able to automatically uncover inconsistencies in the databases that maintain the critical associations between the IP and optical networks.},

@inproceedings{Gopinathan:2008:EOP:1449764.1449784,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider object protocols that constrain interactions between objects in a program. Several such protocols have been proposed in the literature. For many APIs (such as JDOM, JDBC), API designers constrain how API clients interact with API objects. In practice, API clients violate such constraints, as evidenced by postings in discussion forums for these APIs. Thus, it is important that API designers specify constraints using appropriate object protocols and enforce them. The goal of an object protocol is expressed as a protocol invariant. Fundamental properties such as ownership can be expressed as protocol invariants. We present a language, PROLANG, to specify object protocols along with their protocol invariants, and a tool, INVCOP++, to check if a program satisfies a protocol invariant. INVCOP++ separates the problem of checking if a protocol satisfies its protocol invariant (called protocol correctness), from the problem of checking if a program conforms to a protocol (called program conformance). The former is solved using static analysis, and the latter using runtime analysis. Due to this separation (1) errors made in protocol design are detected at a higher level of abstraction, independent of the program's source code, and (2) performance of conformance checking is improved as protocol correctness has been verified statically. We present theoretical guarantees about the way we combine static and runtime analysis, and empirical evidence that our tool INVCOP++ finds usage errors in widely used APIs. We also show that statically checking protocol correctness greatly optimizes the overhead of checking program conformance, thus enabling API clients to test whether their programs use the API as intended by the API designer.},

	Abstract = {Usage data logged from user interactions can be extremely valuable for evaluating software usability. However, instrumenting software to collect usage data is a time-intensive task that often requires technical expertise as well as an understanding of the usability issues to be explored. We have developed a new technique for software instrumentation that removes the need for programming. Interactive Usability Instrumentation (IUI) allows usability evaluators to work directly with a system's interface to specify what components and what events should be logged. Evaluators are able to create higher-level abstractions on the events they log and are provided with real-time feedback on how events are logged. As a proof of the IUI concept, we have created the UMARA system, an instrumentation system that is enabled by recent advances in aspect-oriented programming. UMARA allows users to instrument software without the need for additional coding, and provides tools for specification, data collection, and data analysis. We report on the use of UMARA in the instrumentation of two large open-source projects; our experiences show that IUI can substantially simplify the process of log-based usability evaluation.},

Several systems have addressed limited combinations of these properties, but we address all three in this work. We describe the architecture and implementation of such a framework in Astro-WISE, an astronomical approach to distributed data processing, discovery and retrieval of datasets that achieves scalability via dynamic linking (data lineage) maintained within the system. We show that lineage data collected during the processing and analysis of datasets can be reused to perform selective reprocessing(at sub-image level)ondatasets while the remainder of the dataset is untouched, a rather difficult process to automate without lineage.},

@inproceedings{Tancreti:2011:AHA:2070942.2070972,
	Abstract = {It is important to get an idea of the events occurring in an embedded wireless node when it is deployed in the field, away from the convenience of an interactive debugger. Such visibility can be useful for post-deployment testing, replay-based debugging, and for performance and energy profiling of various software components. Prior software-based solutions to address this problem have incurred high execution overhead and intrusiveness. The intrusiveness changes the intrinsic timing behavior of the application, thereby reducing the fidelity of the collected profile. Prior hardware-based solutions have involved the use of dedicated ASICs or other tightly coupled changes to the embedded node's processor, which significantly limits their applicability.
In this paper, we present Aveksha, a hardware-software approach for achieving the above goals in a non-intrusive manner. Our approach is based on the key insight that most embedded processors have an on-chip debug module (which has traditionally been used for interactive debugging) that provides significant visibility into the internal state of the processor. We design a debug board that interfaces with the on-chip debug module of an embedded node's processor through the JTAG port and provides three modes of event logging and tracing: breakpoint, watchpoint, and program counter polling. Using expressive triggers that the on-chip debug module supports, Aveksha can watch for, and record, a variety of programmable events of interest. A key feature of Aveksha is that the target processor does not have to be stopped during event logging (in the last two of the three modes), subject to a limit on the rate at which logged events occur. Aveksha also performs power monitoring of the embedded wireless node and, importantly, enables power consumption data to be correlated to events of interest.
Aveksha is an operating system-agnostic solution. We demonstrate its functionality and performance using three applications running on Telos motes; two in TinyOS and one in Contiki. We show that Aveksha can trace tasks and other generic events at the function and task-level granularity. We also describe how we used Aveksha to find a subtle bug in the TinyOS low power listening protocol.},

	Abstract = {Service integration is central to joined-up government initiatives and requires information on the collaborators and the services they offer, roles of different actors, the resources required, and their goals (individual and shared). These information are largely available in unstructured forms on government portals, publications and other textural sources. This paper explores semantic text mining for extracting service-related information from such sources using Natural Language Processing techniques supported by Service-Oriented Process Ontologies. Our solution framework consists of the following steps: (1) creating domain and service-oriented process ontology, (2) extracting service-related information from textual sources based on the ontology, and finally (3) mining relationship among the services based on the extracted information in Step 2 linked with a pre-defined hierarchy of service delivery goals specifying the objective(s) to be achieved among the orchestrated services. We describe our approach to these tasks and discuss the progress of the work, our experiences and the challenges encountered so far.},

	Abstract = {Unstructured data is the largest and fastest growing portion of most enterprise's assets, often representing 70% to 80% of online data. These steep increase in volume of information being produced often exceeds the capabilities of existing commercial databases. MapReduce and its open-source implementation Hadoop represent an economically compelling alternative that offers an efficient distributed computing platform for handling large volumes of data and mining petabytes of unstructured information. It is increasingly being used across the enterprise for advanced data analytics, business intelligence, and enabling new applications associated with data retention, regulatory compliance, e-discovery and litigation issues.
However, setting up a dedicated Hadoop cluster requires a significant capital expenditure that can be difficult to justify. Cloud computing offers a compelling alternative and allows users to rent resources in a "pay-as-you-go" fashion. For example, a list of offered Amazon Web Services includes MapReduce environment for rent. It is an attractive and cost-efficient option for many users because acquiring and maintaining complex, large-scale infrastructures is a difficult and expensive decision. One of the open questions in such environments is the amount of resources that a user should lease from the service provider. Currently, there is no available methodology to easily answer this question, and the task of estimating required resources to meet application performance goals is the solely user's responsibility. The users need to perform adequate application testing, performance evaluation, capacity planning estimation, and then request appropriate amount of resources from the service provider. To address these problems we need to understand: "What do we need to know about a MapReduce job for building an efficient and accurate modeling framework? Can we extract a representative job profile that reflects a set of critical performance characteristics of the underlying application during all job execution phases, i.e., map, shuffle, sort and reduce phases? What metrics should be included in the job profile?" We discuss a profiling technique for MapReduce applications that aims to construct a compact job profile that is comprised of performance invariants which are independent of the amount of resources assigned to the job (i.e., the size of the Hadoop cluster) and the size of the input dataset. The challenge is how to accurately predict application performance in the large production environment and for processing large datasets from the application executions that being run in the smaller staging environment and that process smaller input datasets.
One of the major Hadoop benefits is its ability of dealing with failures (disk, processes, node failures) and allowing the user job to complete. The performance implications of failures depend on their types, when do they happen, and whether a system can offer some spare resources instead of failed ones to the running jobs. We discuss how to enhance the MapReduce performance model for evaluating the failure impact on job completion time and predicting a potential performance degradation.
Sharing a MapReduce cluster among multiple applications is a common practice in such environments. However, a key challenge in these shared environments is the ability to tailor and control resource allocations to different applications for achieving their performance goals and service level objectives (SLOs). Currently, there is no job scheduler for MapReduce environments that given a job completion deadline, could allocate the appropriate amount of resources to the job so that it meets the required SLO. In MapReduce environments, many production jobs are run periodically on new data. For example, Facebook, Yahoo!, and eBay process terabytes of data and event logs per day on their Hadoop clusters for spam detection, business intelligence and different types of optimization. For the production jobs that are routinely executed on the new datasets, can we build on-line job profiles that later are used for resource allocation and performance management by the job scheduler? Wediscuss opportunities and challenges for building the SLO-based Hadoop scheduler.
The accuracy of new performance models might depend on the resource contention, especially, the network contention in the production Hadoop cluster. Typically, service providerstend to over provision network resources to avoid undesirable side effects of network contention. At the same time, it is an interesting modeling question whether such a network contention factor can be introduced, measured, and incorporated in theMapReduce performance model. Benchmarking Hadoop, optimizing cluster parameter settings, designing job schedulers with different performance objectives, and constructing intelligent workload management in shared Hadoop clusters create an exciting list of challenges and opportunities for the performance analysis and modeling in MapReduce environments.},

	Abstract = {Today, multimedia data are produced in massive quantities, thanks to a diverse spectrum of applications including entertainment, surveillance, e-commerce, web, and social media. In particular, social media data have three challenging characteristics: data sizes are enormous, data are often multi-faceted, and data are dynamic. Tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) are widely used for representing such high-order dimensional data. Consequently, a system dealing with social media data needs to scale with the tensor volume and the number and diversity of the data facets. This necessitates highly parallelizable, and in many cases cloud-based, frameworks for scalable processing and efficient analysis of large media and social media collections.
Most multimedia applications share a few core operations, including integration/fusion, classification, clustering, graph analysis, near-neighbor search, and similarity search. When performed naively, however, these core operations are often very costly, because the number of objects and object features that need to be considered can be prohibitive. Avoiding this cost requires that redundant work is avoided. Thus, for the next generation cloud-based massive media processing and analysis systems to have transformative impact, the fundamental principles that govern their design must include an awareness of the utilities of data and features to a particular analysis task.
Recently, the observation that - while not all - a significant class of data processing applications can be expressed in terms of a small set of primitives that are, in many cases, easy to parallelize, has led to frameworks, such as MapReduce, which have been successfully applied in data processing, mining, and information retrieval domains. Yet, in many other domains (including many aggregation and join tasks that are hard to parallelize) they significantly lag behind traditional solutions. In particular, many multimedia and social media analysis tasks are in the category of applications that pose significant challenges.
In this talk, I will present an overview of recent developments in the area of scalable multimedia and social media retrieval and analysis in the cloud and our own efforts [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] to build a scalable data processing middleware, called RanKloud, specifically sensitive to the needs and requirements of multimedia and social media analysis applications. RanKloud avoids waste by intelligently partitioning the data and allocating it on available resources to minimize the data replication and indexing overheads and to prune superfluous low-utility processing. It also includes a tensor-based relational data model to support the complete lifecycle (from collection to analysis) of the data, involving various integration and other manipulation steps. RanKloud also addresses the computational cost of various multi-dimensional data analysis operations, including decomposition or structural change detection, by (a) leveraging a priori background knowledge (or metadata) about one or more domain dimensions and (b) by extending compressed sensing (CS) to tensor data to encode the observed tensor streams in the form of compact descriptors.
RanKloud will extend the scope of cloud-based systems to the delivery of efficient and large scale analysis over data with variable utility and, thus, will enable new and efficient applications, tools, and systems for multimedia and social media retrieval and analysis.},

	Abstract = {Understanding, analyzing, and ultimately improving business processes is a goal of enterprises today. These tasks are challenging as business processes in modern enterprises are implemented over several applications and Web services, and the information about process execution is scattered across several data sources. Understanding modern business processes entails identifying the correlation between events in data sources in the context of business processes (event correlation is the process of finding relationships between events that belong to the same process execution instance). In this paper, we investigate the problem of event correlation for business processes that are realized through the interactions of a set of Web services. We identify various ways in which process-related events could be correlated as well as investigate the problem of discovering event correlation (semi-) automatically from service interaction logs. We introduce the concept of process view to represent the process resulting from a certain way of event correlation and that of process space referring to the set of possible process views over process events. Event correlation is a challenging problem as there are various ways in which process events could be correlated, and in many cases, it is subjective. Exploring all the possibilities of correlations is computationally expensive, and only some of the correlated event sets result in process views that are interesting. We propose efficient algorithms and heuristics to identify correlated event sets that lead potentially to interesting process views. To account for its subjectivity, we have designed the event correlation discovery process to be interactive and enable users to guide it toward process views of their interest and organize the discovered process views into a process map that allows users to effectively navigate through the process space and identify the ones of interest. We report on experiments performed on both synthetic and real-world datasets that show the viability and efficiency of the approach.},

	Abstract = {Modern companies continue investing more and more in the creation, maintenance and change of software systems, but the proper specification and design of such systems continues to be a challenge. The majority of current approaches either ignore real user and system runtime behavior or consider it only informally. This leads to a rather prescriptive top-down approach to software development.
In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach, which takes event logs (e.g., trace data) of a software system for the analysis of the user and system runtime behavior and for improving the software. We use well-established methods from the area of process mining for this analysis. Moreover, we suggest embedding process mining into the agile development lifecycle.
The goal of this position paper is to motivate the need for foundational research in the area of software process mining (applying process mining to software analysis) by showing the relevance and listing open challenges. Our proposal is based on our experiences with analyzing a big productive touristic system. This system was developed using agile methods and process mining could be effectively integrated into the development lifecycle.},

	Abstract = {Choreographies are an emergent Service Engineering (SE) approach to compose together and coordinate services in a distributed way. A choreography formalizes the way business participants coordinate their interactions. The focus is not on orchestrations of the work performed within them, but rather on the exchange of messages between these participants. The problems usually addressed when considering a choreography-based specification of the system to be realized are realizability check, and conformance check. In this paper we describe the CHOReOSynt tool, which has been conceived to deal with an additional problem, namely, automated choreography enforcement. That is, when the goal is to actually realize a service choreography by reusing third-party services, their uncontrolled (or wrongly coordinated) composite behavior may show undesired interactions that preclude the choreography realization. CHOReOSynt solves this problem by automatically synthesizing additional software entities that, when interposed among the services, allow for preventing undesired interactions.},

	Abstract = {Australian Public Hospitals are continually engaged in various process improvement activities to improve patient care and to improve hospital efficiency as the demand for service intensifies. As a consequence there are many initiatives within the health sector focusing on gaining insight into the underlying health processes which are assessed for compliance with specified Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Process Mining is classified as a Business Intelligence (BI) tool. The aim of process mining activities is to gain insight into the underlying process or processes. The fundamental element needed for process mining is a historical event log of a process. Generally, these event logs are easily sourced from Process Aware Information Systems (PAIS). Simulation is widely used by hospitals as a tool to study the complex hospital setting and for prediction. Generally, simulation models are constructed by 'hand'. This paper presents a novel way of deriving event logs for health data in the absence of PAIS. The constructed event log is then used as an input for process mining activities taking advantage of existing process mining algorithms aiding the discovery of knowledge of the underlying processes which leads to Health Intelligence (HI). One such output of process mining activity, presented in this paper, is the discovery of process model for simulation using the derived event log as an input for process mining by constructing start-to-end patient journey. The study was undertaken using data from Flinders Medical Centre to gain insight into patient journeys from the point of admission to the Emergency Department (ED) until the patient is discharged from the hospital.},

	Abstract = {Model-Based Testing, the task of generating test inputs and oracles from a test model, has been successfully applied in the context of safety-critical real time systems. As these systems grow in complexity, test-models, designed to reflect the systems behaviour, will grow too. Currently testers face situations where test-models are too complex for present test generators.
In this paper, we outline a software tool for the evaluation of the scalability of a combination of approaches for model-based test generation. We chose Networks of Timed Automata (NTA) as the modeling formalism because real-time properties can be specified and the semantics are well-defined. However, the tool input is given as a restricted UML statechart which is internally transformed. We expect this to increase industrial acceptance. The tool will provide the selection, parametrization and generation of a metaheuristic algorithm. The aim is to support test model specific generation algorithms. A simulator for NTAs will enable the metaheuristic to search for test goals in the model. For better performance, it will have an advanced parallelisation. Furthermore, input models will be used for search space reduction for even faster test case generation. The proposed approach allows the inclusion of an oracle generator that is able to provide expected outputs; this enables conformance checking between test models and systems under test.
We plan to implement the outlined tool to enable test case generation even for models that are beyond the scope of currently available generators.},

	Abstract = {Modern information systems produce tremendous amounts of event data. The area of process mining deals with extracting knowledge from this data. Real-life processes can be effectively discovered, analyzed and optimized with the help of mature process mining techniques. There is a variety of process mining case studies and experience reports from such business areas as healthcare, public, transportation and education. Although nowadays, these techniques are mostly used for discovering business processes.
The goal of this industrial paper is to show that process mining can be applied to software too. Here we present and analyze our experiences on applying process mining in different productive software systems used in the touristic domain. Process models and user interface workflows underlie the functional specifications of the systems we experiment with. When the systems are utilized, user interaction is recorded in event logs. After applying process mining methods to these logs, process and user interface flow models are automatically derived. These resulting models provide insight regarding the real usage of the software, motivate the changes in the functional specifications, enable usability improvements and software redesign.
Thus, with the help of our examples we demonstrate that process mining facilitates new forms of software analysis. The user interaction with almost every software system can be mined in order to improve the software and to monitor and measure its real usage.},

	Abstract = {An undergraduate level Software Engineering courses generally consists of a team-based semester long project and emphasizes on both technical and managerial skills. Software Engineering is a practice-oriented and applied discipline and hence there is an emphasis on hands-on development, process, usage of tools in addition to theory and basic concepts. We present an approach for mining the process data (process mining) from software repositories archiving data generated as a result of constructing software by student teams in an educational setting. We present an application of mining three software repositories: team wiki (used during requirement engineering), version control system (development and maintenance) and issue tracking system (corrective and adaptive maintenance) in the context of an undergraduate Software Engineering course. We propose visualizations, metrics and algorithms to provide an insight into practices and procedures followed during various phases of a software development life-cycle. The proposed visualizations and metrics (learning analytics) provide a multi-faceted view to the instructor serving as a feedback tool on development process and quality by students. We mine the event logs produced by software repositories and derive insights such as degree of individual contributions in a team, quality of commit messages, intensity and consistency of commit activities, bug fixing process trend and quality, component and developer entropy, process compliance and verification. We present our empirical analysis on a software repository dataset consisting of 19 teams of 5 members each and discuss challenges, limitations and recommendations.},

Tailoring happens, in general, through variations in the process elements, such as activities, artifacts, and control flows. This paper aims to introduce a technique that uses process mining to uncover elements from the software process that are candidates for tailoring. The proposed approach analyzes the execution logs from several process instances that share a common standard process. As a result, execution traces that differ from the standard process flow are identified and assessed to uncover their variable elements. The proposed technique was evaluated with data extracted from a real software development scenario when a large system was under development for a set of Brazilian Federal Institutes of Education, Science and Technology.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive Case Management (ACM) is a new paradigm that facilitates the coordination of knowledge work through case handling. Current ACM systems, however, lack support of providing sophisticated user guidance for next step recommendations and predictions about the case future. In recent years, process mining research developed approaches to make recommendations and predictions based on event logs readily available in process-aware information systems. This paper builds upon those approaches and integrates them into an existing ACM solution. The research goal is to design and develop a prototype that gives next step recommendations and predictions based on process mining techniques in ACM systems. The models proposed, recommend actions that shorten the case running time, mitigate deadline transgressions, support case goals and have been used in former cases with similar properties. They further give case predictions about the remaining time, possible deadline violations, and whether the current case path supports given case goals. A final evaluation proves that the prototype is indeed capable of making proper recommendations and predictions. In addition, starting points for further improvement are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In business process models, elements can be scattered (repeated) within different processes, making it difficult to handle changes, analyze process for improvements, or check crosscutting impacts. These scattered elements are named as Aspects. Similar to the aspect-oriented paradigm in programming languages, in BPM, aspect handling has the goal to modularize the crosscutting concerns spread across the models. This process modularization facilitates the management of the process (reuse, maintenance and understanding). The current approaches for aspect identification are made manually; thus, resulting in the problem of subjectivity and lack of systematization. This paper proposes a method to automatically identify aspects in business process from its event logs. The method is based on mining techniques and it aims to solve the problem of the subjectivity identification made by specialists. The initial results from a preliminary evaluation showed evidences that the method identified correctly the aspects present in the process model.},

	Abstract = {There are two important artifacts in any Architecture-Conformance Checking (ACC) approach: i) the representation of the PA and ii) the representation of the CA. Many times, inside the same ACC approach, distinct meta-models are adopted for representing the PA and the CA. Besides, it is common the adoption of meta-models unsuitable for representing architectural details. This heterogeneity makes the checking algorithms complex since they must cope with instances that comply with two different meta-models or do not have proper architectural abstractions. KDM is an ISO meta-model proposed by OMG whose goal is to become the standard representation of systems in modernization tools. It is able to represent many aspects of a software system, including source code details, architectural abstractions and the dependencies between them. However, up to this moment, there is no research showing how KDM can be used in ACC approaches. Therefore we present an investigation of adopting KDM as the unique meta-model for representing PA and CA in ACC approaches. We have developed a three-steps ACC approach called ArchKDM. In the first step a DSL assists in the PA specification; in the second step an Eclipse plug-in provides the necessary support and in the last step the checking is conducted. We have also evaluate our approach using two real world systems and the results were very promising, revealing no false positives or negatives.},

	Abstract = {Real-time predictive applications can demand continuous and agile development, with new models constantly being trained, tested, and then deployed. Training and testing are done by replaying stored event logs, running new models in the context of historical data in a form of backtesting or "what if?" analysis. To replay weeks or months of logs while developers wait, we need systems that can stream event logs through prediction logic many times faster than the real-time rate. A challenge with high-speed replay is preserving sequential semantics while harnessing parallel processing power. The crux of the problem lies with causal dependencies inherent in the sequential semantics of log replay.
We introduce an execution engine that produces serial-equivalent output while accelerating throughput with pipelining and distributed parallelism. This is made possible by optimizing for high throughput rather than the traditional stream processing goal of low latency, and by aggressive sharing of versioned state, a technique we term Multi-Versioned Parallel Streaming (MVPS). In experiments we see that this engine, which we call ReStream, performs as well as batch processing and more than an order of magnitude better than a single-threaded implementation.},

We introduce a novel similarity metric for grouping traces into clusters that incorporates temporal information about activity performance and handles concurrent activities. Our data-driven recommender system selects the appropriate prototype performance of the process based on user-provided context attributes. Our approach for determining the prototypes discovers the commonly performed activities and their temporal relationships. We tested our system on data from three real-world medical processes and achieved recommendation accuracy up to an F1 score of 0.77 (compared to an F1 score of 0.37 using ZeroR) with 63.2% of recommended enactments being within the first five neighbors of the actual historic enactments in a set of 87 cases.

	Abstract = {Serious games are video games with educational purposes. Players interact in many points during a gameplay. These interactions can be registered, producing data sets with sequence of events which provide relevant information about player's skills. Unfortunately, traditional skill assessment methods present limitations to carry out a detailed analysis of large data sets. Sequence Analysis is a group of techniques which allow to analyze data sets consisting of sequence of events. These techniques have been successfully implemented in different fields, and we consider that they can help overcome these limitations. In this paper, we propose an architecture of skill assessment in learning experiences based on serious games using a set of Sequence Analysis techniques known as Process Mining. First, several in-game events are stored in a log. These events are produced by player's interactions with Key Performance Indicators included in the game. Second, event log is used as input for a Process Mining tool. Discovery process is executed and a behavioural model is provided. Third, an assessment metric must be carried out over the model. Finally, a synthetic experiment is conducted and promising results are obtained.},

	Abstract = {Background. Process mining is a technique to build process models from "execution logs" (i.e., events triggered by the execution of a process). State-of-the-art tools can provide process managers with different graphical representations of such models. Managers use these models to compare them with an ideal process model or to support process improvement. They typically select the representation based on their experience and knowledge of the system. Aim. This work studies how to automatically build process models representing the actual intents (or uses) of users while interacting with a software system. Such intents are expressed as a set of actions performed by a user to a system to achieve specific use goals. Method. This work applies the theory of Hidden Markov Models to mine use logs and automatically model the use of a system. Results. Unlike the models generated with process mining tools, the Hidden Markov Models automatically generated in this study provide the intents of a user and can be used to recommend managers with a faithful representation of the use of their systems. Conclusions. The automatic generation of the Hidden Markov Models can achieve a good level of accuracy in representing the actual user's intents provided the log dataset is carefully chosen. In our study, the information contained in one-month set of logs helped automatically build Hidden Markov Models with superior accuracy and similar expressiveness of the models built together with the company's stakeholder.},

	Abstract = {Uncorrectable errors in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) are a common form of hardware failure in server clusters. Failures are costly both in terms of hardware replacement costs and service disruption. While a large body of work exists on analyzing DRAM reliability in large production clusters, little has been reported on the automatic prediction of such errors ahead of time. In this paper, we present a highly accurate predictive model, based on daily event logs and sensor measurements, in a large fleet of commodity servers going back to 2014. By correlating correctable errors with sensor metrics, we can use ensemble machine learning techniques to predict uncorrectable errors weeks in advance.
In addition, we show how such models can be applied in the wild and consumed by customer support teams. Our goal is to minimize false positives, as healthy DRAMs should not be replaced, while accounting for common limitations, such as missing data points and rare occurences of uncorrectable errors.},

	Abstract = {Predictive business process monitoring methods exploit historical process execution logs to provide predictions about running instances of a process, which enable process workers and managers to preempt performance issues or compliance violations. A number of approaches have been proposed to predict quantitative process performance indicators, such as remaining cycle time, cost, or probability of deadline violation. However, these approaches adopt a black-box approach, insofar as they predict a single scalar value without decomposing this prediction into more elementary components. In this paper, we propose a white-box approach to predict performance indicators of running process instances. The key idea is to first predict the performance indicator at the level of activities, and then to aggregate these predictions at the level of a process instance by means of flow analysis techniques. The paper specifically develops this idea in the context of predicting the remaining cycle time of ongoing process instances. The proposed approach has been evaluated on four real-life event logs and compared against several baselines.},

This paper describes the application of process mining in one of the provincial offices of the Dutch National Public Works Department, responsible for the construction and maintenance of the road and water infrastructure. Using a variety of process mining techniques, we analyzed the processing of invoices sent by the various subcontractors and suppliers from three different perspectives: (1) the process perspective, (2) the organizational perspective, and (3) the case perspective. For this purpose, we used some of the tools developed in the context of the ProM framework. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of process mining in general and our algorithms and tools in particular.},

Today's information systems (e.g., ERP systems) log all kinds of events. Moreover, also embedded systems (e.g., medical equipment, copiers, and other high-tech systems) start producing detailed event logs. The omnipresence of event logs is an important enabler for process mining. The primary goal of process mining is to extract knowledge from these logs and use it for a detailed analysis of reality. Lion's share of the efforts in this domain has been devoted to control-flow discovery. Many algorithms have been proposed to construct a process model based on an analysis of the event sequences observed in the log. As a result, other aspects have been neglected, e.g., the organizational setting and interactions among coworkers. Therefore, we focus on organizational mining. We will present techniques to discover organizational models and social networks and show how these models can assist in improving the underlying processes. To do this, we present new process mining techniques but also use existing techniques in an innovative manner. The approach has been implemented in the context of the ProM framework and has been applied in various case studies. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of our techniques by analyzing the logs of a municipality in the Netherlands.},

	Abstract = {During the last years a new generation of process-aware information systems has emerged, which enables process model configurations at buildtime as well as process instance changes during runtime. Respective model adaptations result in a large number of model variants that are derived from the same process model, but slightly differ in structure. Generally, such model variants are expensive to configure and maintain. In this paper we address two scenarios for learning from process model adaptations and for discovering a reference model out of which the variants can be configured with minimum efforts. The first one is characterized by a reference process model and a collection of related process variants. The goal is to improve the original reference process model such that it fits better to the variant models. The second scenario comprises a collection of process variants, while the original reference model is unknown; i.e., the goal is to ``merge'' these variants into a new reference process model. We suggest two algorithms that are applicable in both scenarios, but have their pros and cons. We provide a systematic comparison of the two algorithms and further contrast them with conventional process mining techniques. Comparison results indicate good performance of our algorithms and also show that specific techniques are needed for learning from process configurations and adaptations. Finally, we provide results from a case study in automotive industry in which we successfully applied our algorithms.},

	Abstract = {A prominent goal of process mining is to build automatically a model explaining all the episodes recorded in the log of some transactional system. Whenever the process to be mined is complex and highly-flexible, however, equipping all the traces with just one model might lead to mixing different usage scenarios, thereby resulting in a spaghetti-like process description. This is, in fact, often circumvented by preliminarily applying clustering methods on the process log in order to identify all its hidden variants. In this paper, two relevant problems that arise in the context of applying such methods are addressed, which have received little attention so far: (i) making the clustering aware of outlier traces, and (ii) finding predictive models for clustering results. The first issue impacts on the effectiveness of clustering algorithms, which can indeed be led to confuse real process variants with exceptional behavior or malfunctions. The second issue instead concerns the opportunity of predicting the behavioral class of future process instances, by taking advantage of context-dependent ``non-structural'' data (e.g., activity executors, parameter values). The paper formalizes and analyzes these two issues and illustrates various mining algorithms to face them. All the algorithms have been implemented and integrated into a system prototype, which has been thoroughly validated over two real-life application scenarios.},

	Abstract = {Business processes leave trails in a variety of data sources (e.g., audit trails, databases, and transaction logs). Hence, every process instance can be described by a trace, i.e., a sequence of events. Process mining techniques are able to extract knowledge from such traces and provide a welcome extension to the repertoire of business process analysis techniques. Recently, process mining techniques have been adopted in various commercial BPM systems (e.g., BPM|one, Futura Reflect, ARIS PPM, Fujitsu Interstage, Businesscape, Iontas PDF, and QPR PA). Unfortunately, traditional process discovery algorithms have problems dealing with less structured processes. The resulting models are difficult to comprehend or even misleading. Therefore, we propose a new approach based on trace alignment. The goal is to align traces in such a way that event logs can be explored easily. Trace alignment can be used to explore the process in the early stages of analysis and to answer specific questions in later stages of analysis. Hence, it complements existing process mining techniques focusing on discovery and conformance checking. The proposed techniques have been implemented as plugins in the ProM framework. We report the results of trace alignment on one synthetic and two real-life event logs, and show that trace alignment has significant promise in process diagnostic efforts.},

	Abstract = {Currently, automated learning systems are widely used for educational and training purposes within various organisations including, schools, universities and further education centres. There has been a big gap between the extraction of useful patterns from data sources to knowledge, as it is crucial that data is made valid, novel, potentially useful and understandable. To meet the needs of intended users, there is requirement for learning systems to embody technologies that support learners in achieving their learning goals and this process don't happen automatically. This paper propose a novel approach for automated learning that is capable of detecting changing trends in learning behaviours and abilities through the use of process mining techniques. The goal is to discover user interaction patterns within learning processes, and respond by making decisions based on adaptive rules centred on captured user profiles. The approach applies semantic annotation of activity logs within the learning process in order to discover patterns automatically by means of semantic reasoning. Therefore, our proposed approach is grounded on Semantic Modelling and Process Mining techniques. To this end, it is possible to apply effective reasoning methods to make inferences over a Learning Process Knowledge-Base that leads to automated discovery of learning patterns or behaviour.},

	Abstract = {A business process (BP) consists of a set of activities which are performed in coordination in an organizational and technical environment and which jointly realize a business goal. In such context, BP management (BPM) can be seen as supporting BPs using methods, techniques, and software in order to design, enact, control, and analyze operational processes involving humans, organizations, applications, and other sources of information. Since the accurate management of BPs is receiving increasing attention, conformance checking, i.e., verifying whether the observed behavior matches a modelled behavior, is becoming more and more critical. Moreover, declarative languages are more frequently used to provide an increased flexibility. However, whereas there exist solid conformance checking techniques for imperative models, little work has been conducted for declarative models. Furthermore, only control-flow perspective is usually considered although other perspectives (e.g., data) are crucial. In addition, most approaches exclusively check the conformance without providing any related diagnostics. To enhance the accurate management of flexible BPs, this work presents a constraint-based approach for conformance checking over declarative BP models (including both control-flow and data perspectives). In addition, two constraint-based proposals for providing related diagnosis are detailed. To demonstrate both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed approaches, the analysis of different performance measures related to a wide diversified set of test models of varying complexity has been performed.},

	Abstract = {Objectives
Process model comparison and similar process retrieval is a key issue to be addressed in many real-world situations, and a particularly relevant one in medical applications, where similarity quantification can be exploited to accomplish goals such as conformance checking, local process adaptation analysis, and hospital ranking. In this paper, we present a framework that allows the user to: (i) mine the actual process model from a database of process execution traces available at a given hospital; and (ii) compare (mined) process models. The tool is currently being applied in stroke management.
Methods
Our framework relies on process mining to extract process-related information (i.e., process models) from data. As for process comparison, we have modified a state-of-the-art structural similarity metric by exploiting: (i) domain knowledge; (ii) process mining outputs and statistical temporal information. These changes were meant to make the metric more suited to the medical domain.
Results
Experimental results showed that our metric outperforms the original one, and generated output closer than that provided by a stroke management expert. In particular, our metric correctly rated 11 out of 15 mined hospital models with respect to a given query. On the other hand, the original metric correctly rated only 7 out of 15 models. The experiments also showed that the framework can support stroke management experts in answering key research questions: in particular, average patient improvement decreased as the distance (according to our metric) from the top level hospital process model increased.
Conclusions
The paper shows that process mining and process comparison, through a similarity metric tailored to medical applications, can be applied successfully to clinical data to gain a better understanding of different medical processes adopted by different hospitals, and of their impact on clinical outcomes. In the future, we plan to make our metric even more general and efficient, by explicitly considering various methodological and technological extensions. We will also test the framework in different domains.},

	Abstract = {To meet increasing needs in the field of maintenance, we studied the dynamic aspect of process and services on a maintenance platform, a major challenge in process mining and knowledge engineering. Hence, we propose a dynamic experience feedback approach to exploit maintenance process behaviors in real execution of the maintenance platform. An active learning process exploiting event log is introduced by taking into account the dynamic aspect of knowledge using trace engineering. Our proposal makes explicit the underlying knowledge of platform users by means of a trace-based system called ``PETRA''. The goal of this system is to extract new knowledge rules about transitions and activities in maintenance processes from previous platform executions as well as its user (i.e. maintenance operators) interactions. While following a Knowledge Traces Discovery process and handling the maintenance ontology IMAMO, ``PETRA'' is composed of three main subsystems: tracking, learning and knowledge capitalization. The capitalized rules are shared in the platform knowledge base in order to be reused in future process executions. The feasibility of this method is proven through concrete use cases involving four maintenance processes and their simulation.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents results of process mining implementation in a characteristically unstructured customer fulfilment process in a real Telecommunication Company. The aim of process mining implementation is firstly to discover the typical customer fulfilment business process. It is also aimed at assessing the current rate of completed customer fulfilment, the typical component required for the process and the lead time for different types of customer requests. The steps to achieve the goals are to prepare, extract the data and construct the event log from the company's in house built Customer Relationship Management systems. The event log is then processed using Disco and PROM tools. The complete event log when model with Disco results in a Spaghetti-like process model with 673 different variants. In order to identify typical process, the log is filtered to include only business variants with 1% case occurrence of the total case. This enables the identification of 18 typical business variants, which differ based on the order requested, sequence of activities and occurrence of Return Work Order. Based on the typical variants, the components required to fulfil a certain order are identified. Another important findings are the fact that the completion rate is very low (only 8%). This may due to the fact that the issues faced by the field officer in processing the order and the resolution are either recorded manually or in a different systems. Finally, findings from this study can be used by the company to improve their current business process. It also stressed out the importance of resolving data integration issues in implementation of process mining in real cases.},

	Abstract = {Process mining techniques aim to extract insights in processes from event logs. One of the challenges in process mining is identifying interesting and meaningful event labels that contribute to a better understanding of the process. Our application area is mining data from smart homes for elderly, where the ultimate goal is to signal deviations from usual behavior and provide timely recommendations in order to extend the period of independent living. Extracting individual process models showing user behavior is an important instrument in achieving this goal. However, the interpretation of sensor data at an appropriate abstraction level is not straightforward. For example, a motion sensor in a bedroom can be triggered by tossing and turning in bed or by getting up. We try to derive the actual activity depending on the context (time, previous events, etc.). In this paper we introduce the notion of label refinements, which links more abstract event descriptions with their more refined counterparts. We present a statistical evaluation method to determine the usefulness of a label refinement for a given event log from a process perspective. Based on data from smart homes, we show how our statistical evaluation method for label refinements can be used in practice. Our method was able to select two label refinements out of a set of candidate label refinements that both had a positive effect on model precision.},

	Abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) is a quickly developing management theory in recent years. The goal of BPM is to improve corporate performance by managing and optimizing the businesses process in and among enterprises. The goal is easier to achieve with the closed-loop feedback mechanism from business process execution to redesign in BPM life cycle, where the business process itself and the set of activities in BPM are viewed as a controlled object and a controller respectively. In this feedback control system, process mining plays an important role in generating feedback of process execution for redesign. However, the existing discovery methods cannot mine certain special structures from execution logs (e.g., implicit dependency, implicit place and short loops) correctly and their mining efficiencies cannot meet the requirements of online process mining. In this paper, we propose a novel discovery method to overcome these challenges based on a kind of augmented event log that will also bring new research directions for process discovery. A case study is presented for introducing how the mined model can be used in business process evolution. Results of experiments are described to show the improvements of the proposed algorithm compared with others.},

The thresholds can be used as an analysis axis of data exploration to investigate process models that are discovered from huge logs. The proposed method enables users to minimize the time needed to detect KPI thresholds through trial and error. We applied the method to real-life logs and experiment results showed that thresholds were detected for two types of KPIs. Although one type did not correlate with process patterns, the other highly correlated with them. Such findings are usually obtained from the domain knowledge of business users and analysis results acquired by data analysts with technical expertise. However, with our approach the thresholds can be detected automatically and this helps to expand process analysis for end users.},

This situation together with the recommender technologies deluge and the particularities of the news industry pose challenges to the news organization in making decisions about the most suitable strategy. Therefore, we propose process mining as a high-level, end-to-end solution to provide insights into the consumers' behavior and content dynamics. Specifically, we explore if it allows news organizations to analyze independently and effectively their data in order to support them in defining recommender strategies. The solution was implemented in a case study with the third largest news provider in Norway and yielded preliminary positive results. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply a process mining methodology and adapt the techniques to support media industry with the recommender strategies.},

The main objective of the study was to investigate the performance of a private hospital treatment processes in Bangkok based on the event logs. Being aware of the fact that currently healthcare systems of majority of hospitals worldwide are equipped with information systems, provided us a great opportunity to access large amounts of the medical data with the intention of the research and knowledge discovery purposes. In this paper, we emphasized on the ``Time Performance'' of the process instances of the collected event logs from different wards/sections of a hospital in order to better visualize and study the behavior of patients referring to the following sections/wards (as well as the hospital's administrators/personnel attending to each case) during the entire treatment processes. . The results showed that the treatment process with respect to the waiting time was too long between the wards ``Irradiation cystitis'' and ``Osteoradionecrosi'' sections allocating 7.8 waiting time to themselves. Subsequently, the findings of the research can be used in order to help the hospital administrators and managers to better understand the amount of waiting time spent between different treatment processes in such a way that they can improve the performance of handling patients' demands and needs in a more efficient, effective and timely manner, eventually leading to increased customer satisfaction and better performance.},

One of the most challenging process mining tasks is process discovery, i.e., the automatic construction of process models from raw event logs. Today there are dozens of process discovery techniques generating process models using different notations (Petri nets, EPCs, BPMN, heuristic nets, etc.). This paper focuses on the representational bias used by these techniques. We will show that the choice of target model is very important for the discovery process itself.

	Abstract = {Based on the state of the art of process mining, we can conclude that quality characteristics (failure rate metrics or loops) are poorly represented or absent in most predictive models that can be found in the literature. The main goal of this present research work is to analyze how to learn prediction model defining failure as response variable. A model of this type can be used for active real-time-controlling (e. g. through the reassignment of workflow activities based on prediction results) or for the automated support of redesign (i.e., prediction results are transformed in software requirements used to implement process improvements). The proposed methodology is based on the application of a data mining process because the objective of this work can be considered as a data mining goal.},

	Abstract = {Given the ever changing needs of the job markets, education and training centers are increasingly held accountable for student success. Therefore, education and training centers have to focus on ways to streamline their offers and educational processes in order to achieve the highest level of quality in curriculum contents and managerial decisions. Educational process mining is an emerging field in the educational data mining (EPM) discipline, concerned with developing methods to discover, analyze and provide a visual representation of complete educational processes. In this paper, we present our distributed computation platform, under construction, which allows different education centers and institutions to load their data and access to advanced data mining and process mining services. To achieve this, we present also a comparative study of the different clustering techniques developed in the context of process mining to partition efficiently educational traces. Our goal is to find the best strategy for distributing heavy analysis computations on many processing nodes of our platform.},

	Abstract = {Process mining algorithms use event logs to learn and reason about processes by technically coupling event history data and process models. During the execution of a learning process, several events occur which are of interest and/or necessary for completing and achieving a learning goal. The work in this paper describes a Semantic Process Mining approach directed towards automated learning. The proposed approach involves the extraction of process history data from learning execution environments, which is then followed by submitting the resulting eXtensible Event Streams (XES) and Mining eXtensible Markup Language (MXML) format to the process analytics environment for mining and further analysis. The XES and MXML data logs are enriched by using Semantic Annotations that references concepts in an Ontology specifically designed for representing learning processes. This involves the identification and modelling of data about different users. The approach focuses on augmenting information values of the resulting model based on individual learner profiles. A series of validation experiments were conducted in order to prove how Semantic Process Mining can be utilized to address the problem of analyzing concepts and relationships amongst learning objects, which also aid in discovering new and enhancement of existing learning processes. To this end, we demonstrate how data from learning processes can be extracted, semantically prepared, and transformed into mining executable formats for improved analysis.},

With respect to traditional, structured operational processes, they present an high degree of uncertainty and heterogeneity with little or no structure. As a consequence, traditional business intelligence tools are mostly not suitable for innovation processes. Although the innovation promotion has become one of the hottest topic in business economy in last decades and its importance in organization growth is widely recognized, currently there are not proposal in Literature for the automatic analysis of innovation activities performed by an organization. Our research is hence aimed to investigate such activities and their corresponding innovation processes, by taking into account the way in which they are really performed in organization daily job.

The goal of this environment is two-fold. Firstly it will provide a reliable disaster information source to facilitate the exchange and the analysis of previous crisis information. Secondly, it will assimilate best practices and provide recommendations based on experiences from previous disasters. One of the first steps towards such an environment is to elaborate a common and generic disaster model. This model is also a reference to define a template for the case base of previous disasters. In order for our system to provide recommendations based on previous practices, we combine case based reasoning with process mining.

Unlike synthesis techniques (e.g., based on regions), process mining aims at the discovery of models (e.g., Petri nets) from incomplete information (i.e., only example behavior is given). The more mature process mining techniques perform well on structured processes. However, most of the existing techniques fail miserably when confronted with unstructured processes. This paper attempts to "bring structure to the unstructured" by using an integrated combination of abstraction and clustering techniques.

	Abstract = {Clinical pathway is a crucial tool for care quality improvement and expense control. Compared to expertdesigned clinical pathway, the topic-based clinical pathway mined from history data is more dynamic and adaptive for real-world application. In this approach, the latent topics discovered by topic modeling are treated as the clinical goals, so that each patient trace is converted to a topic-based sequence. Process mining is used to generate a concise process model on these sequences. However, there is a common problem about the topic modeling that the redundancy between different topics is considerable. It means that some clinical activities strongly correlate to many topics, which has a significant impact on the ability of representing clinical goals of the topics. This paper proposed a novel topic modeling method for clinical goal discovering. Domain knowledge is incorporated to limit the available topic size for each clinical activity. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in discovering quality topics as the clinical goals for clinical pathway mining.},

	Abstract = {This thesis proposes a hybrid log alert detection scheme, which incorporates anomaly detection and signature generation to accomplish its goal. Unlike previous work, minimum apriori knowledge of the system being analyzed is assumed. This assumption enhances the platform portability of the framework. The anomaly detection component works in a bottom-up manner on the contents of historical system log data to detect regions of the log, which contain anomalous (alert) behaviour. The identified anomalous regions (after inspection by a human administrator through a visualization system) are then passed to the signature generation component, which mines them for patterns. Consequently, future occurrences of the underlying alert in the anomalous log region, can be detected on a production system using the discovered patterns. The combination of anomaly detection and signature generation, which is novel when compared to previous work, ensures that a framework which is accurate while still being able to detect new and unknown alerts is attained.},

Automated recognition and extraction of these instances enables advanced requirements management features, such as automated traceability, template conformance checking, guided editing, and interoperability with requirements management tools such as RequisitePro. The variability in content and physical representation of these instances poses challenges to their accurate recognition and extraction. To address these challenges, we present a framework allowing 1) the specification of logical structures in terms of their content, textual rendering, and variability and 2) the extraction of instances of such structures from rich-text documents. Our evaluation involves 36 different logical structures identified in 43 SRDs and shows that the intended content, style, and variability of these structures can be specified in the framework such that their instances can be extracted from the documents with high precision and recall, both close to 100%.},

	Abstract = {Context. Boilerplates have long been used in Requirements Engineering (RE) to increase the precision of natural language requirements and to avoid ambiguity problems caused by unrestricted natural language. When boilerplates are used, an important quality assurance task is to verify that the requirements indeed conform to the boilerplates. Objective. If done manually, checking conformance to boilerplates is laborious, presenting a particular challenge when the task has to be repeated multiple times in response to requirements changes. Our objective is to provide automation for checking conformance to boilerplates using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique, called Text Chunking, and to empirically validate the effectiveness of the automation. Method. We use an exploratory case study, conducted in an industrial setting, as the basis for our empirical investigation. Results. We present a generalizable and tool-supported approach for boilerplate conformance checking. We report on the application of our approach to the requirements document for a major software component in the satellite domain. We compare alternative text chunking solutions and argue about their effectiveness for boilerplate conformance checking. Conclusion. Our results indicate that: (1) text chunking provides a robust and accurate basis for checking conformance to boilerplates, and (2) the effectiveness of boilerplate conformance checking based on text chunking is not compromised even when the requirements glossary terms are unknown. This makes our work particularly relevant to practice, as many industrial requirements documents have incomplete glossaries.},

Although, there are a number of centralized orchestration engines to execute business processes described by BPEL language in SOA, you may find several decentralized orchestration engines and their purpose is to decompose a BPEL process to several software agents to improve some quality factors. On one hand, choosing a suitable method of process distribution may result in better adaptability of process with run-time environment. On the other hand, in the new generation of service oriented architecture (SOA), service level agreements (SLAs) are of paramount important. We need to have a run-time environment to improve the adaptability of run-time environment with SLAs. Thus, this paper we are going to to combine process distribution methods and SLAs. To reach this goal, firstly, we introduce an intelligent method of using process mining for business process distribution (IPD). Secondly, we compare different methods of processes distribution including fully, semi and intelligent process distribution methods. We also show the comparison of these methods considering quality factors such as total execution time, band width usage, agent granularity, resource adaptability, memory usage of agents, number of produced agents and total system adaptability. Thirdly, we consider all of the distribution methods from an SLA view through which users can determine their requirements of executing business processes to be mapped to run-time environment.},

To analyze event logs, using intrusion detection systems and active network monitoring, honeynets are being deployed to attract potential attackers in order to investigate their modus operandi. The goal is to use honeynet clusters as real-time warning systems in production networks. Towards satisfying this objective, we have built a honeynet cluster and have run experiments to determine its effectiveness. Majority of the honeynets function in isolation, not sharing information in real time. In order to rectify this deficiency, the authors built a federation of cooperating honeynets (referred to as knowledge sharing honeynets) that shares knowledge of malicious traffic.

Computer-mediated interaction has introduced many unique forms of tie data to the field. The form of data used in this research are traces of activity left when people create and edit digital artifacts, and when navigating around hyperlinked environments. Using intentional and unintentional traces of activity to generate social graphs provides a unique window into collaboration and interaction. This paper elaborates a technique that uses event log data to trace contingencies in user activity and generate directed two-mode graphs, associograms, which can then be abstracted to sociogram representations. The social network ties generated represent connections between people based on actions contingent on one another. These ties can be used to represent potential social connections for collaboration, social collectives for coordination, and stigmergic self-organization.},

	Abstract = {A modern diagnostic imaging system integrates several PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) through datacenters that allow a large community of users to access and share sensitive patient medical images. In such integration user access to the medical images that are stored in non-local PACS systems is based on a trust model, which makes data integrity and privacy vulnerable due to possible malicious user behaviors. Moreover, the limited scope and precision of the existing policy-based access control solutions prevent them from detecting suspicious behaviors of the authenticated users. In this paper, we propose an approach for analyzing the user behaviors that allows the administrators to identify the users whose behaviors may jeopardize the data privacy and system integrity. In this context, the system administrator can define an arbitrary pattern of a suspicious user behavior using our new behavior pattern language. A constraint-based pattern-matching engine will identify the instances of the suspicious behavior pattern in the system's audit-log repository. Finally, a decision support system will present the excerpt findings to the system administrator with the overall goal of refining the access control policy rules. We present a case study which indicates our proposed approach provides promising results.},

	Abstract = {The main goal of change management is to ensure that standardized methods and procedures are used for the efficient and prompt handling of changes in IT systems, in order to minimize change-related incidents and service-delivery disruption. To meet this goal, it is of paramount importance reusing the experience acquired from previous changes in the design of subsequent ones. Two distinct approaches may be usefully combined to this end. In a top-down approach, IT operators may manually design change templates based on the knowledge owned/acquired in the past. Considering a reverse, bottom-up perspective, these templates could be discovered from past execution traces gathered from IT provisioning tools. While the former has been satisfactorily explored in previous investigations, the latter - despite its undeniable potential to result in accurate templates in a reduced time scale - has not been subject of research, as far as the authors are aware of, by the service operations and management community. To fill in this gap, this paper proposes a solution, inspired on process mining techniques, to discover change templates from past changes. The solution is analyzed through a prototypical implementation of a change template miner subsystem called CHANGEMINER, and a set of experiments based on a real-life scenario.},

The goal is to determine the network-wide reachability using static analysis of configuration files gathered from forwarding devices. We describe a method that can compute the reachability in networks with a mix of static routing configurations, distance vector routing protocols, filtering routing updates and redistributions. The method computes a network-wide approximation of distributed routing information using the standard graph algorithms. Thus, for any network state, we can determine a set of active paths used for packet delivery. The outcomes of the method can be, for instance, used during the conformance checking of distributed access control lists against network security policies.},

	Abstract = {A large percentage of computing capacity in today's large high-performance computing systems is wasted because of failures. Consequently current research is focusing on providing fault tolerance strategies that aim to minimize fault's effects on applications. By far the most popular technique is the checkpointrestart strategy. A complement to this classical approach is failure avoidance, by which the occurrence of a fault is predicted and preventive measures are taken. This requires a reliable prediction system to anticipate failures and their locations. Thus far, research in this field has used ideal predictors that were not implemented in real HPC systems. In this paper, we merge signal analysis concepts with data mining techniques to extend the ELSA (Event Log Signal Analyzer) toolkit and offer an adaptive and more efficient prediction module. Our goal is to provide models that characterize the normal behavior of a system and the way faults affect it. Being able to detect deviations from normality quickly is the foundation of accurate fault prediction. However, this is challenging because component failure dynamics are heterogeneous in space and time. To this end, a large part of the paper is focused on a detailed analysis of the prediction method, by applying it to two large-scale systems and by investigating the characteristics and bottlenecks of each step of the prediction process. Furthermore, we analyze the prediction's precision and recall impact on current checkpointing strategies and highlight future improvements and directions for research in this field.},

	Abstract = {Local Process Model (LPM) discovery is focused on the mining of a set of process models where each model describes the behavior represented in the event log only partially, i.e. subsets of possible events are taken into account to create so-called local process models. Often such smaller models provide valuable insights into the behavior of the process, especially when no adequate and comprehensible single overall process model exists that is able to describe the traces of the process from start to end. The practical application of LPM discovery is however hindered by computational issues in the case of logs with many activities (problems may already occur when there are more than 17 unique activities). In this paper, we explore three heuristics to discover subsets of activities that lead to useful log projections with the goal of speeding up LPM discovery considerably while still finding high-quality LPMs. We found that a Markov clustering approach to create projection sets results in the largest improvement of execution time, with discovered LPMs still being better than with the use of randomly generated activity sets of the same size. Another heuristic, based on log entropy, yields a more moderate speedup, but enables the discovery of higher quality LPMs. The third heuristic, based on the relative information gain, shows unstable performance: for some data sets the speedup and LPM quality are higher than with the log entropy based method, while for other data sets there is no speedup at all.},

	Abstract = {Accurate prediction of the completion time of a business process instance would constitute a valuable tool when managing processes under service level agreement constraints. Such prediction, however, is a very challenging task. A wide variety of factors could influence the trend of a process instance, and hence just using time statistics of historical cases cannot be sufficient to get accurate predictions. Here we propose a new approach where, in order to improve the prediction quality, both the control and the data flow perspectives are jointly used. To achieve this goal, our approach builds a process model which is augmented by time and data information in order to enable remaining time prediction. The remaining time prediction of a running case is calculated combining two factors: (a) the likelihood of all the following activities, given the data collected so far; and (b) the remaining time estimation given by a regression model built upon the data.},
