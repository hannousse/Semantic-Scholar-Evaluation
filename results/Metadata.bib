@inproceedings{Debbiche:2014,
	Abstract = {The complexity of software development has increased over the last few years. Customers today demand higher quality and more stable software with shorter delivery time. Software companies strive to improve their processes in order to meet theses challenges. Agile practices have been widely praised for the focus they put on customer collaboration and shorter feedback loops. Companies that have well established agile practices have been trying to improve their processes further by adopting continuous integration - the concept where teams integrate their code several times a day. However, adopting continuous integration is not a trivial task. This paper presents a case study in which we, based on interviews at a major Swedish telecommunication services and equipment provider, assess the challenges of continuous integration. The study found 23 adoption challenges that organisations may face when adopting the continuous integration process.},

@article{Claps:2015,
	Abstract = {Context
Continuous Deployment (CD) is an emerging software development process with organisations such as Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM successfully implementing and using the process. The CD process aims to immediately deploy software to customers as soon as new code is developed, and can result in a number of benefits for organisations, such as: new business opportunities, reduced risk for each release, and prevent development of wasted software. There is little academic literature on the challenges organisations face when adopting the CD process, however there are many anecdotal challenges that organisations have voiced on their online blogs.
Objective
The aim of this research is to examine the challenges faced by organisations when adopting CD as well as the strategies to mitigate these challenges.
Method
An explorative case study technique that involves in-depth interviews with software practitioners in an organisation that has adopted CD was conducted to identify these challenges.
Results
This study found a total of 20 technical and social adoption challenges that organisations may face when adopting the CD process. The results are discussed to gain a deeper understanding of the strategies employed by organisations to mitigate the impacts of these challenges.
Conclusion
While a number of individual technical and social adoption challenges were uncovered by the case study in this research, most challenges were not faced in isolation. The severity of these challenges were reduced by a number of mitigation strategies employed by the case study organisation. It is concluded that organisations need to be well prepared to handle technical and social adoption challenges with their existing expertise, processes and tools before adopting the CD process. For practitioners, knowing how to address the challenges an organisation may face when adopting the CD process provides a level of awareness that they previously may not have had.},

@article{Brandtner:2015,
	Abstract = {Context
Continuous Integration (CI) has become an established best practice of modern software development. Its philosophy of regularly integrating the changes of individual developers with the master code base saves the entire development team from descending into Integration Hell, a term coined in the field of extreme programming. In practice, CI is supported by automated tools to cope with this repeated integration of source code through automated builds and testing. One of the main problems, however, is that relevant information about the quality and health of a software system is both scattered across those tools and across multiple views.
Objective
This paper introduces a quality awareness framework for CI-data and its conceptional model used for the data integration and visualization. The framework called SQA-Mashup makes use of the service-based mashup paradigm and integrates information from the entire CI-toolchain into a single service.
Method
The research approach followed in our work consists out of (i) a conceptional model for data integration and visualization, (ii) a prototypical framework implementation based on tool requirements derived from literature, and (iii) a controlled user study to evaluate its usefulness.
Results
The results of the controlled user study showed that SQA-Mashup's single point of access allows users to answer questions regarding the state of a system more quickly (57%) and accurately (21.6%) than with standalone CI-tools.
Conclusions
The SQA-Mashup framework can serve as one-stop shop for software quality data monitoring in a software development project. It enables easy access to CI-data which otherwise is not integrated but scattered across multiple CI-tools. Our dynamic visualization approach allows for a tailoring of integrated CI-data according to information needs of different stakeholders such as developers or testers.},

@article{Li:2007a,
	Abstract = {Bad smells are used as a means to identify problematic classes in object-oriented systems for refactoring. The belief that the bad smells are linked with problematic classes is largely based on previous metric research results. Although there is a plethora of empirical studies linking software metrics to errors and error proneness of classes in object-oriented systems, the link between the bad smells and class error probability in the evolution of object-oriented systems after the systems are released has not been explored. There has been no empirical evidence linking the bad smells with class error probability so far. This paper presents the results from an empirical study that investigated the relationship between the bad smells and class error probability in three error-severity levels in an industrial-strength open source system. Our research, which was conducted in the context of the post-release system evolution process, showed that some bad smells were positively associated with the class error probability in the three error-severity levels. This finding supports the use of bad smells as a systematic method to identify and refactor problematic classes in this specific context.},

	Abstract = {Context
Code smells are manifestations of design flaws that can degrade code maintainability. So far, no research has investigated if these indicators are useful for conducting system-level maintainability evaluations.
Aim
The research in this paper investigates the potential of code smells to reflect system-level indicators of maintainability.
Method
We evaluated four medium-sized Java systems using code smells and compared the results against previous evaluations on the same systems based on expert judgment and the Chidamber and Kemerer suite of metrics. The systems were maintained over a period of up to 4 weeks. During maintenance, effort (person-hours) and number of defects were measured to validate the different evaluation approaches.
Results
Most code smells are strongly influenced by size; consequently code smells are not good indicators for comparing the maintainability of systems differing greatly in size. Also, from the comparison of the different evaluation approaches, expert judgment was found as the most accurate and flexible since it considered effects due to the system's size and complexity and could adapt to different maintenance scenarios.
Conclusion
Code smell approaches show promise as indicators of the need for maintenance in a way that other purely metric-based approaches lack.},

@article{Taibi:2017,
	Abstract = {Context. In recent years, smells, also referred to as bad smells, have gained popularity among developers. However, it is still not clear how harmful they are perceived from the developers' point of view. Many developers talk about them, but only few know what they really are, and even fewer really take care of them in their source code. Objective. The goal of this work is to understand the perceived criticality of code smells both in theory, when reading their description, and in practice. Method. We executed an empirical study as a differentiated external replication of two previous studies. The studies were conducted as surveys involving only highly experienced developers (63 in the first study and 41 in the second one). First the perceived criticality was analyzed by proposing the description of the smells, then different pieces of code infected by the smells were proposed, and finally their ability to identify the smells in the analyzed code was tested. Results. According to our knowledge, this is the largest study so far investigating the perception of code smells with professional software developers. The results show that developers are very concerned about code smells in theory, nearly always considering them as harmful or very harmful (17 out of 23 smells). However, when they were asked to analyze an infected piece of code, only few infected classes were considered harmful and even fewer were considered harmful because of the smell. Conclusions. The results confirm our initial hypotheses that code smells are perceived as more critical in theory but not as critical in practice.},

@article{Walter:2016,
	Abstract = {Context---Design patterns represent recommended generic solutions to various design problems, whereas code smells are symptoms of design issues that could hinder further maintenance of a software system. We can intuitively expect that both concepts are mutually exclusive, and the presence of patterns is correlated with the absence of code smells. However, the existing experimental evidence supporting this claim is still insufficient, and studies separately analyzing the impact of smells and patterns on code quality deliver diverse results. Objective---The aim of the paper is threefold: (1) to determine if and how the presence of the design patterns is linked to the presence of code smells, (2) to investigate if and how these relationships change throughout evolution of code, and (3) to identify the relationships between individual patterns and code smells. Method---We analyze nine design patterns and seven code smells in two medium-size, long-evolving, open source Java systems. In particular, we explore how the presence of design patterns impacts the presence of code smells, analyze if this link evolves over time, and extract association rules that describe their individual relationships. Results---Classes participating in design patterns appear to display code smells less frequently than other classes. The observed effect is stronger for some patterns (e.g., Singleton, State-Strategy) and weaker for others (e.g., Composite). The ratio between the relative number of smells in the classes participating in patterns and the relative number of smells in other classes, is approximately stable or slightly decreasing in time. Conclusion---This observation could be used to anticipate the smell-proneness of individual classes, and improve code smell detectors. Overall, our findings indicate that the presence of design patterns is linked with a lower number of code smell instances. This could support programmers in a context-sensitive analysis of smells in code.},

	Abstract = {Context
Code smells are indicators of poor coding and design choices that can cause problems during software maintenance and evolution.
Objective
This study is aimed at a detailed investigation to which extent problems in maintenance projects can be predicted by the detection of currently known code smells.
Method
A multiple case study was conducted, in which the problems faced by six developers working on four different Java systems were registered on a daily basis, for a period up to four weeks. Where applicable, the files associated to the problems were registered. Code smells were detected in the pre-maintenance version of the systems, using the tools Borland Together and InCode. In-depth examination of quantitative and qualitative data was conducted to determine if the observed problems could be explained by the detected smells.
Results
From the total set of problems, roughly 30% percent were related to files containing code smells. In addition, interaction effects were observed amongst code smells, and between code smells and other code characteristics, and these effects led to severe problems during maintenance. Code smell interactions were observed between collocated smells (i.e., in the same file), and between coupled smells (i.e., spread over multiple files that were coupled).
Conclusions
The role of code smells on the overall system maintainability is relatively minor, thus complementary approaches are needed to achieve more comprehensive assessments of maintainability. Moreover, to improve the explanatory power of code smells, interaction effects amongst collocated smells and coupled smells should be taken into account during analysis.},

	Abstract = {DevOps as an emerging paradigm aims to tightly integrate developers with operations personnel. This enables fast and frequent releases in the sense of continuously delivering new iterations of a particular application. Users and customers of today's Web applications and mobile apps running in the Cloud expect fast feedback to problems and feature requests. Thus, it is a critical competitive advantage to be able to respond quickly. Besides cultural and organizational changes that are necessary to apply DevOps in practice, tooling is required to implement end-to-end automation of deployment processes. Automation is the key to efficient collaboration and tight integration between development and operations. The DevOps community is constantly pushing new approaches, tools, and open-source artifacts to implement such automated processes. However, as all these proprietary and heterogeneous DevOps automation approaches differ from each other, it is hard to integrate and combine them to deploy applications in the Cloud using an automated deployment process. In this paper we present a systematic classification of DevOps artifacts and show how different kinds of artifacts can be discovered and transformed toward TOSCA, which is an emerging standard. We present an integrated modeling and runtime framework to enable the seamless and interoperable integration of different approaches to model and deploy application topologies. The framework is implemented by an open-source, end-to-end toolchain. Moreover, we validate and evaluate the presented approach to show its practical feasibility based on a detailed case study, in particular considering the performance of the transformation toward TOSCA.},

	Abstract = {Context
A lot of different quality assurance techniques exist to ensure high quality products. However, most often they are applied in isolation. A systematic combination of different static and dynamic quality assurance techniques promises to exploit synergy effects, such as higher defect detection rates or reduced quality assurance costs. However, a systematic overview of such combinations and reported evidence about achieving synergy effects with such kinds of combinations is missing.
Objective
The main goal of this article is the classification and thematic analysis of existing approaches that combine different static and dynamic quality assurance technique, including reported effects, characteristics, and constraints. The result is an overview of existing approaches and a suitable basis for identifying future research directions.
Method
A systematic mapping study was performed by two researchers, focusing on four databases with an initial result set of 2498 articles, covering articles published between 1985 and 2010.
Results
In total, 51 articles were selected and classified according to multiple criteria. The two main dimensions of a combination are integration (i.e., the output of one quality assurance technique is used for the second one) and compilation (i.e., different quality assurance techniques are applied to ensure a common goal, but in isolation). The combination of static and dynamic analyses is one of the most common approaches and usually conducted in an integrated manner. With respect to the combination of inspection and testing techniques, this is done more often in a compiled way than in an integrated way.
Conclusion
The results show an increased interest in this topic in recent years, especially with respect to the integration of static and dynamic analyses. Inspection and testing techniques are currently mostly performed in an isolated manner. The integration of inspection and testing techniques is a promising research direction for the exploitation of additional synergy effects.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Distributed software development (DSD) has intensified over the past few years, and DSD project management is more complex than collocated project management. However, no systematic research effort has focused on aggregating evidence from the scientific literature to build models to support project management on DSD context. For these reasons, the goal of this paper is to build an evidence-based model of DSD project management from the research findings about challenges of DSD and the practices, models and tools proposed and used to overcome these challenges. We based the construction of this model on the evidence collected and synthesized by a comprehensive systematic mapping study of 70 research papers published between 1997 and 2009. We believe that our results can help practitioners and researchers to better understand the challenges and implement more effective solutions to improve project management within distributed project management teams. These results also provide a mapping of the research about DSD project management, identifying areas where further research is needed. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This systematic review identifies empirical studies of knowledge management initiatives in software engineering, and discusses the concepts studied, the major findings, and the research methods used. Seven hundred and sixty-two articles were identified, of which 68 were studies in an industry context. Of these, 29 were empirical studies and 39 reports of lessons learned. More than half of the empirical studies were case studies. The majority of empirical studies relate to technocratic and behavioural aspects of knowledge management, while there are few studies relating to economic, spatial and cartographic approaches. A finding reported across multiple papers was the need to not focus exclusively on explicit knowledge, but also consider tacit knowledge. We also describe implications for research and for practice.},

	Abstract = {Context
Quality assurance effort, especially testing effort, is often a major cost factor during software development, which sometimes consumes more than 50% of the overall development effort. Consequently, one major goal is often to reduce testing effort.
Objective
The main goal of the systematic mapping study is the identification of existing approaches that are able to reduce testing effort. Therefore, an overview should be presented both for researchers and practitioners in order to identify, on the one hand, future research directions and, on the other hand, potential for improvements in practical environments.
Method
Two researchers performed a systematic mapping study, focusing on four databases with an initial result set of 4020 articles.
Results
In total, we selected and categorized 144 articles. Five different areas were identified that exploit different ways to reduce testing effort: approaches that predict defect-prone parts or defect content, automation, test input reduction approaches, quality assurance techniques applied before testing, and test strategy approaches.
Conclusion
The results reflect an increased interest in this topic in recent years. A lot of different approaches have been developed, refined, and evaluated in different environments. The highest attention was found with respect to automation and prediction approaches. In addition, some input reduction approaches were found. However, in terms of combining early quality assurance activities with testing to reduce test effort, only a small number of approaches were found. Due to the continuous challenge of reducing test effort, future research in this area is expected.},

Comparing and contrasting evidence from multiple studies is necessary to build knowledge and reach conclusions about the empirical support for a phenomenon. Therefore, research synthesis is at the center of the scientific enterprise in the software engineering discipline.
Objective
The objective of this article is to contribute to a better understanding of the challenges in synthesizing software engineering research and their implications for the progress of research and practice.
Method
A tertiary study of journal articles and full proceedings papers from the inception of evidence-based software engineering was performed to assess the types and methods of research synthesis in systematic reviews in software engineering.
Results
As many as half of the 49 reviews included in the study did not contain any synthesis. Of the studies that did contain synthesis, two thirds performed a narrative or a thematic synthesis. Only a few studies adequately demonstrated a robust, academic approach to research synthesis.
Conclusion
We concluded that, despite the focus on systematic reviews, there is limited attention paid to research synthesis in software engineering. This trend needs to change and a repertoire of synthesis methods needs to be an integral part of systematic reviews to increase their significance and utility for research and practice.},

	Abstract = {Context
Since the introduction of evidence-based software engineering in 2004, systematic literature review (SLR) has been increasingly used as a method for conducting secondary studies in software engineering. Two tertiary studies, published in 2009 and 2010, identified and analysed 54 SLRs published in journals and conferences in the period between 1st January 2004 and 30th June 2008.
Objective
In this article, our goal was to extend and update the two previous tertiary studies to cover the period between 1st July 2008 and 31st December 2009. We analysed the quality, coverage of software engineering topics, and potential impact of published SLRs for education and practice.
Method
We performed automatic and manual searches for SLRs published in journals and conference proceedings, analysed the relevant studies, and compared and integrated our findings with the two previous tertiary studies.
Results
We found 67 new SLRs addressing 24 software engineering topics. Among these studies, 15 were considered relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum, and 40 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. We found that the number of SLRs in software engineering is increasing, the overall quality of the studies is improving, and the number of researchers and research organisations worldwide that are conducting SLRs is also increasing and spreading.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the software engineering research community is starting to adopt SLRs consistently as a research method. However, the majority of the SLRs did not evaluate the quality of primary studies and fail to provide guidelines for practitioners, thus decreasing their potential impact on software engineering practice.},

	Abstract = {Background
In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference.
Aims
This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence.
Method
We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings.
Results
Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4.
Conclusions
Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners.},

Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) have emerged as a new paradigm to develop interoperable and highly dynamic applications.
Objective
This paper aims to identify the state of the art in the research on testing in Service Oriented Architectures with dynamic binding.
Method
A mapping study has been performed employing both manual and automatic search in journals, conference/workshop proceedings and electronic databases.
Results
A total of 33 studies have been reviewed in order to extract relevant information regarding a previously defined set of research questions. The detection of faults and the decision making based on the information gathered from the tests have been identified as the main objectives of these studies. To achieve these goals, monitoring and test case generation are the most proposed techniques testing both functional and non-functional properties. Furthermore, different stakeholders have been identified as participants in the tests, which are performed in specific points in time during the life cycle of the services. Finally, it has been observed that a relevant group of studies have not validated their approach yet.
Conclusions
Although we have only found 33 studies that address the testing of SOA where the discovery and binding of the services are performed at runtime, this number can be considered significant due to the specific nature of the reviewed topic. The results of this study have contributed to provide a body of knowledge that allows identifying current gaps in improving the quality of the dynamic binding in SOA using testing approaches.},

	Abstract = {Background
Many papers are published on the topic of software metrics but it is difficult to assess the current status of metrics research.
Aim
This paper aims to identify trends in influential software metrics papers and assess the possibility of using secondary studies to integrate research results.
Method
Search facilities in the SCOPUS tool were used to identify the most cited papers in the years 2000--2005 inclusive. Less cited papers were also selected from 2005. The selected papers were classified according factors such as to main topic, goal and type (empirical or theoretical or mixed). Papers classified as ``Evaluation studies'' were assessed to investigate the extent to which results could be synthesized.
Results
Compared with less cited papers, the most cited papers were more frequently journal papers, and empirical validation or data analysis studies. However, there were problems with some empirical validation studies. For example, they sometimes attempted to evaluate theoretically invalid metrics and fail to appreciate the importance of the context in which data are collected.
Conclusions
This paper, together with other similar papers, confirms that there is a large body of research related to software metrics. However, software metrics researchers may need to refine their empirical methodology before they can answer useful empirical questions.},

	Abstract = {Service-Oriented computing can be characterized as the motivating force for interoperable web applications. Businesses that embark on service-oriented technology are inclined to an effective interoperation with other businesses. This interoperation not only can expand businesses' markets but also allow the provision of quality services to citizens for carrying out their everyday transactions. However for an effective utilization of service-oriented computing a variety of other technologies must be involved namely semantics, pragmatics, effective search techniques, intelligent agents and pervasive services. In this paper we focus in one of the phases of service-oriented computing, the web service discovery, and propose an effective pragmatic and pervasive methodology that will enable potential business partners to discover the web services/processes of their interest. We are particularly emphasizing on the importance of pragmatics and their application during web service discovery, because only a pragmatic consideration can provide complete and unambiguous meaning to web service usage.},

@inproceedings{Rukanova:2006,
	Abstract = {The developments in the ICT led companies to strive to make parts of the business transaction electronic and raised again the issue of interoperability. Although interoperability between computer systems has been widely addressed in literature, the concept of interoperability between organizations is still to a large extent unexplored. Standards are claimed to help achieving interoperability. However, experience with the implementation of EDI standards shows that many EDI implementation projects led to technical solutions with unclear business benefits. New standards are currently being developed, however their implementation can also lead again to purely technical solution, if the social context is not taken sufficiently into account. In this paper we address the problem on how to identify interoperability problems on a pragmatic level that can occur between organizations that want to carry out business transactions electronically. We also point out that, in order to identify interoperability problems on a pragmatic level, it is necessary to capture the communication requirements of the business parties and to evaluate to what extent a standard is capable to meet these requirements. To perform that evaluation we develop a meta model for describing communication. The meta model is based on theory of speech-act and communicative actions. The use of the meta model to identify interoperability problems on a pragmatic level is illustrated with an example.},

	Abstract = {Open innovation is a powerful framework encompassing the generation, capture, and employment of intellectual property at the firm level. We identify three fundamental challenges for firms in applying the concept of open innovation: finding creative ways to exploit internal innovation, incorporating external innovation into internal development, and motivating outsiders to supply an ongoing stream of external innovations. This latter challenge involves a paradox, why would firms spend money on R\&D efforts if the results of these efforts are available to rival firms? To explore these challenges, we examine the activity of firms in open-source software to support their innovation strategies. Firms involved in open-source software often make investments that will be shared with real and potential rivals. We identify four strategies firms employ -- pooled R\&D/product development, spinouts, selling complements and attracting donated complements -- and discuss how they address the three key challenges of open innovation. We conclude with suggestions for how similar strategies may apply in other industries and offer some possible avenues for future research on open innovation.},

	Abstract = {The link between firms engaging in open source software (OSS) development and the OSS community is established by individual developers. This linkage might entail a principal-agent issue due to the developer's double allegiance to firm and OSS community, and expose the firm to the risk of losing intellectual property. Using both interviews and a large-scale survey, I substantiate the importance of the developer's role. However, neither interview data nor regression analysis show indications of commercially harmful revealing behavior induced by "Free Software ideology." Management, on the other hand, sometimes seems to be overly concerned about openness. I conclude that a more positive stance towards openness will allow firms to better share in the benefits of open innovation processes. Copyright 2009 , Oxford University Press.},

@article{Ebner:2009,
	Abstract = {`Crowdsourcing' is currently one of the most discussed key words within the open innovation community. The major question for both research and business is how to find and lever the enormous potential of the `collective brain' to broaden the scope of `open R\&D'. Based on a literature review in the fields of Community Building and Innovation Management, this work develops an integrated framework called `Community Engineering for Innovations'. This framework is evaluated in an Action Research project -- the case of an ideas competition for an ERP Software company. The case `SAPiens' includes the design, implementation and evaluation of an IT-supported ideas competition within the SAP University Competence Center (UCC) User Group. This group consists of approximately 60,000 people (lecturers and students) using SAP Software for educational purposes. The current challenges are twofold: on the one hand, there is not much activity yet in this community. On the other, SAP has not attempted to systematically address this highly educated group for idea generation or innovation development so far. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a framework for a community-based innovation development that generates innovations, process and product ideas in general and for SAP Research, in particular, combining the concepts of idea competitions and virtual communities. Furthermore, the concept aims at providing an interface to SAP Human Resources processes in order to identify the most promising students in this virtual community. This paper is the first to present an integrated concept for IT-supported idea competitions in virtual communities for leveraging the potential of crowds that is evaluated in a real-world setting.},

	Abstract = {The private-collective innovation model proposes incentives for individuals and firms to privately invest resources to create public goods innovations. Such innovations are characterized by non-rivalry and non-exclusivity in consumption. Examples include open source software, user-generated media products, drug formulas, and sport equipment designs. There is still limited empirical research on private-collective innovation. We present a case study to (1) provide empirical evidence of a case of private-collective innovation, showing specific benefits, and (2) to extend the private-collective innovation model by analyzing the hidden costs for the company involved. We examine the development of the Nokia Internet Tablet, which builds on both proprietary and open source software development, and that involves both Nokia developers and volunteers who are not employed by the company. Seven benefits for Nokia are identified, as are five hidden costs: difficulty to differentiate, guarding business secrets, reducing community entry barriers, giving up control, and organizational inertia. We examine the actions taken by the management to mitigate these costs throughout the development period.},

@article{Dittrich:2007,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to investigate how innovation networks can be used to deal with a changing technological environment. This study combines different concepts related to research and development (R\&D) collaboration strategies of large firms and applies these concepts to R\&D alliance projects undertaken by Nokia Corporation in the period 1985--2002. The research methodology is a combination of in-depth semistructured interviews and a large-scale quantitative analysis of alliance agreements. For the empirical analysis a distinction is made between exploration and exploitation in innovation networks in terms of three different measures. As a first measure, the difference between exploration and exploitation strategies by means of the observed capabilities of the partners of the contracting firms is investigated. The second measure is related to partner turnover. The present article argues that in exploration networks partner turnover will be higher than in exploitation networks. As a third measure, the type of alliance contract will be taken; exploration networks will make use of flexible legal organizational structures, whereas exploitation alliances are associated with legal structures that enable long-term collaboration. The case of Nokia has illustrated the importance of strategic technology networks for strategic repositioning under conditions of change. Nokia followed an exploitation strategy in the development of the first two generations of mobile telephony and an exploration strategy in the development of technologies for the third generation. Such interfirm networks seem to offer flexibility, speed, innovation, and the ability to adjust smoothly to changing market conditions and new strategic opportunities. These two different strategies have led to distinctly different international innovation networks, have helped the company in becoming a world leader in the mobile phone industry, and have enabled it to sustain that position in a radically changed technological environment. This study also illustrates that Nokia effectively uses an open innovation strategy in the development of new products and services and in setting technology standards for current and future use of mobile communication applications. This article presents one of the first longitudinal studies, which describes the use of innovation networks as a means to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions and strategic change. This study contributes to the emerging, but still inconsistent, literature on explorative and exploitative learning by means of strategic technology networks.},

@article{Rohrbeck:2009,
	Abstract = {When, on 21st September 2006, `The Economist' compared incumbent telecommunication operators with dinosaurs that could soon face extinction, most readers were ready to agree. The mixture of declining revenues and fierce competition was believed to shake the market and soon to dethrone former national champions. However, there are ways to fight that extinction and one way is to open up for competitive advantage. This paper reflects on a case study at Deutsche Telekom, the German national telecommunication operator. The aim of this study is to analyse to what extent the open innovation paradigm has been embraced inside this now multinational company. Using empirical evidence from 15 in-depth interviews, we identify 11 open innovation instruments and detail their value contribution. We can show that Deutsche Telekom has successfully enhanced its innovation capacity by opening up its traditional development process and embracing external creativity and knowledge resources.},

	Abstract = {Many studies reported that software maintenance, traditionally defined as any modification made on a software system after its delivery, consumes up to 90% of the total cost of a typical software project. Adding new functionalities, correcting bugs, and modifying the code to improve its quality are major parts of those costs. To ease these maintenance activities, one of the most used techniques is the refactoring which improves design structure while preserving the external behavior. In general, refactoring is performed through two main steps: (1) detection of code fragments corresponding to design defects that need to be improved/fixed and (2) identification of refactoring solutions to achieve this goal. Our research project targets the automation of these two refactoring steps. Concretely, we consider the detection step as a search-based process to find the suitable detection rules for each type of design defect, by means of a genetic algorithm. To guide the rule-derivation process, real examples of design defects are used. For the refactoring identification step, a multiobjective search-based approach is also used. The process aims at finding the optimal sequence of refactoring operations that improve the software quality by minimizing the number of detected defects. In addition, we explore other objectives to optimize: the effort needed to apply refactorings, semantic preservation, and the similarity with good refactorings applied in the past to similar contexts. Hence, the effort corresponds to the code modification/adaptation score needed to apply the suggested refactoring solutions. On the other hand, the semantic preservation insures that the refactored program is semantically equivalent to the original one, and that it models correctly the domain semantics. Indeed, we use knowledge from historical code changes to propose new refactoring solutions in similar contexts to improve the automation of refactoring.},

	Abstract = {Refactoring is performed to improve software quality while leaving the behaviour of the system unchanged. In practice there are many opportunities for refactoring, however, due to conflicts and dependencies between refactorings, only certain orders of refactorings are applicable. Selecting and ordering an appropriate set of refactorings is a challenging task for a developer. We propose a novel automated approach to scheduling refactorings according to their conflicts and dependencies as well as their contribution to design quality expressed by a desired design. The desired design is an improved version of the current program design, and is produced by the developer. Our approach is capable of detecting conflicts and dependencies between refactorings, and uses a sequence alignment algorithm to identify the degree of similarity between two program designs expressed as sequence of characters, thereby measuring the contribution of a refactoring to achieving the desired design. We evaluated our approach on several sample programs and one non-trivial open source application. Our results demonstrate the ability of the approach to order the input refactorings so as to achieve the desired design even in the presence of intense inter-refactoring conflict and dependency, and when applied to a medium-sized, real-world application.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Object-oriented systems that undergo repeated addition of functionality commonly suffer a loss of quality in their underlying design. This problem must often be remedied in a costly refactoring phase before further maintenance programming can take place. Recently search-based approaches to automating the task of software refactoring, based on the concept of treating object-oriented design as a combinatorial optimization problem, have been proposed. However, because search-based refactoring is a novel approach it is yet to be established as to which search techniques are most suitable for the task. In this paper we report the results of an empirical comparison of simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithms (GAs) and multiple ascent hill-climbing (HCM) in search-based refactoring. A prototype automated refactoring tool is employed, capable of making radical changes to the design of an existing program in order that it conforms more closely to a contemporary quality model. Results show HCM to outperform both SA and GA over a set of five input programs. Copyright {\copyright} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Abdellatief:2013,
	Abstract = {A component-based software system (CBSS) is a software system that is developed by integrating components that have been deployed independently. In the last few years, many researchers have proposed metrics to evaluate CBSS attributes. However, the practical use of these metrics can be difficult. For example, some of the metrics have concepts that either overlap or are not well defined, which could hinder their implementation. The aim of this study is to understand, classify and analyze existing research in component-based metrics, focusing on approaches and elements that are used to evaluate the quality of CBSS and its components from a component consumer's point of view. This paper presents a systematic mapping study of several metrics that were proposed to measure the quality of CBSS and its components. We found 17 proposals that could be applied to evaluate CBSSs, while 14 proposals could be applied to evaluate individual components in isolation. Various elements of the software components that were measured are reviewed and discussed. Only a few of the proposed metrics are soundly defined. The quality assessment of the primary studies detected many limitations and suggested guidelines for possibilities for improving and increasing the acceptance of metrics. However, it remains a challenge to characterize and evaluate a CBSS and its components quantitatively. For this reason, much effort must be made to achieve a better evaluation approach in the future.},

	Abstract = {The importance of mobile application specific testing techniques and methods has been attracting much attention of software engineers over the past few years. This is due to the fact that mobile applications are different than traditional web and desktop applications, and more and more they are moving to being used in critical domains. Mobile applications require a different approach to application quality and dependability and require an effective testing approach to build high quality and more reliable software. We performed a systematic mapping study to categorize and to structure the research evidence that has been published in the area of mobile application testing techniques and challenges that they have reported. Seventy nine (79) empirical studies are mapped to a classification schema. Several research gaps are identified and specific key testing issues for practitioners are identified: there is a need for eliciting testing requirements early during development process; the need to conduct research in real-world development environments; specific testing techniques targeting application life-cycle conformance and mobile services testing; and comparative studies for security and usability testing.},

	Abstract = {Context
Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is an emerging discipline that focuses on the application of search-based optimization techniques to software engineering problems. Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software systems whose members are distinguished by the set of features each one provides. SPL development practices have proven benefits such as improved software reuse, better customization, and faster time to market. A typical SPL usually involves a large number of systems and features, a fact that makes them attractive for the application of SBSE techniques which are able to tackle problems that involve large search spaces.
Objective
The main objective of our work is to identify the quantity and the type of research on the application of SBSE techniques to SPL problems. More concretely, the SBSE techniques that have been used and at what stage of the SPL life cycle, the type of case studies employed and their empirical analysis, and the fora where the research has been published.
Method
A systematic mapping study was conducted with five research questions and assessed 77 publications from 2001, when the term SBSE was coined, until 2014.
Results
The most common application of SBSE techniques found was testing followed by product configuration, with genetic algorithms and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms being the two most commonly used techniques. Our study identified the need to improve the robustness of the empirical evaluation of existing research, a lack of extensive and robust tool support, and multiple avenues worthy of further investigation.
Conclusions
Our study attested the great synergy existing between both fields, corroborated the increasing and ongoing interest in research on the subject, and revealed challenging open research questions.},

@article{DaMostaSilveiraNeto:2011,
	Abstract = {Context
In software development, Testing is an important mechanism both to identify defects and assure that completed products work as specified. This is a common practice in single-system development, and continues to hold in Software Product Lines (SPL). Even though extensive research has been done in the SPL Testing field, it is necessary to assess the current state of research and practice, in order to provide practitioners with evidence that enable fostering its further development.
Objective
This paper focuses on Testing in SPL and has the following goals: investigate state-of-the-art testing practices, synthesize available evidence, and identify gaps between required techniques and existing approaches, available in the literature.
Method
A systematic mapping study was conducted with a set of nine research questions, in which 120 studies, dated from 1993 to 2009, were evaluated.
Results
Although several aspects regarding testing have been covered by single-system development approaches, many cannot be directly applied in the SPL context due to specific issues. In addition, particular aspects regarding SPL are not covered by the existing SPL approaches, and when the aspects are covered, the literature just gives brief overviews. This scenario indicates that additional investigation, empirical and practical, should be performed.
Conclusion
The results can help to understand the needs in SPL Testing, by identifying points that still require additional investigation, since important aspects regarding particular points of software product lines have not been addressed yet.},

Software Reliability (SR) is a highly active and dynamic research area. Published papers have approached this topic from various and heterogeneous points of view, resulting in a rich body of literature on this topic. The counterpart to this is the considerable complexity of this body of knowledge.
Objective
The objective of this study is to obtain a panorama and a taxonomy of Software Reliability Modeling (SRM).
Method
In order to do this, a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) which analyzes and structures the literature on Software Reliability Modeling has been carried out.
Results
A total of 972 works were obtained as a result of the Systematic Mapping Study. On the basis of the more than 500 selected primary studies found, the results obtained show an increasing diversity of work.
Conclusion
Although it was discovered that Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGM) are still the most common modeling technique, it was also found that both the modeling based on static and architectural characteristics and the models based on Artificial Intelligence and automatic learning techniques are increasingly more apparent in literature. We have also observed that most Software Reliability Modeling efforts take place in the Pacific Rim area and in academic environments. Industrial initiatives are as yet marginal, and would appear to be primarily located in the USA.},

	Abstract = {Context
The Web has had a significant impact on all aspects of our society. As our society relies more and more on the Web, the dependability of web applications has become increasingly important. To make these applications more dependable, for the past decade researchers have proposed various techniques for testing web-based software applications. Our literature search for related studies retrieved 147 papers in the area of web application testing, which have appeared between 2000 and 2011.
Objective
As this research area matures and the number of related papers increases, it is important to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the publications and provide an overview of the trends in this specialized field.
Method
We review and structure the body of knowledge related to web application testing through a systematic mapping (SM) study. As part of this study, we pose two sets of research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria, and systematically develop and refine a classification schema. In addition, we conduct a bibliometrics analysis of the papers included in our study.
Results
Our study includes a set of 79 papers (from the 147 retrieved papers) published in the area of web application testing between 2000 and 2011. We present the results of our systematic mapping study. Our mapping data is available through a publicly-accessible repository. We derive the observed trends, for instance, in terms of types of papers, sources of information to derive test cases, and types of evaluations used in papers. We also report the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain, including top-cited papers, active countries and researchers, and top venues in this research area.
Conclusion
We discuss the emerging trends in web application testing, and discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners in this area. The results of our systematic mapping can help researchers to obtain an overview of existing web application testing approaches and indentify areas in the field that require more attention from the research community.},

Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor reflecting technical compromises that can yield short-term benefit but may hurt the long-term health of a software system.
Objective
This work aims at collecting studies on TD and TD management (TDM), and making a classification and thematic analysis on these studies, to obtain a comprehensive understanding on the TD concept and an overview on the current state of research on TDM.
Method
A systematic mapping study was performed to identify and analyze research on TD and its management, covering publications between 1992 and 2013.
Results
Ninety-four studies were finally selected. TD was classified into 10 types, 8 TDM activities were identified, and 29 tools for TDM were collected.
Conclusions
The term ``debt'' has been used in different ways by different people, which leads to ambiguous interpretation of the term. Code-related TD and its management have gained the most attention. There is a need for more empirical studies with high-quality evidence on the whole TDM process and on the application of specific TDM approaches in industrial settings. Moreover, dedicated TDM tools are needed for managing various types of TD in the whole TDM process.},

Combining software architecture and agile development has received significant attention in recent years. However, there exists no comprehensive overview of the state of research on the architecture-agility combination.
Objective
This work aims to analyze the combination of architecture and agile methods for the purpose of exploration and analysis with respect to architecting activities and approaches, agile methods and practices, costs, benefits, challenges, factors, tools, and lessons learned concerning the combination.
Method
A systematic mapping study (SMS) was conducted, covering the literature on the architecture-agility combination published between February 2001 and January 2014.
Results
Fifty-four studies were finally included in this SMS. Some of the highlights: (1) a significant difference exists in the proportion of various architecting activities, agile methods, and agile practices employed in the combination. (2) none of the architecting approaches has been widely used in the combination. (3) there is a lack of description and analysis regarding the costs and failure stories of the combination. (4) twenty challenges, twenty-nine factors, and twenty-five lessons learned were identified.
Conclusions
The results of this SMS help the software engineering community to reflect on the past thirteen years of research and practice on the architecture-agility combination with a number of implications.},

Few studies have paid attention to User-Generated Content and its application to the improvement of business processes, even though there has been an increase in reported cases in recent years. Through a systematic mapping study of the Ebsco{\textregistered} database, we looked for articles that addressed this issue of user-generated content since its first appearance of up to 2015. In a first view, we confirmed the paucity of research related to this theme, even with the large increase of social media studies. As findings, we identified some important research trends towards public organizations using the content created by citizens to improve public services, as well as companies using social media tools to improve innovation processes. On the other hand, we identified gaps in the research, such as in journalism, engaging readers as information providers, and social media, being used for the improvement of the e-learning process.},

	Abstract = {Search-based software testing is the application of metaheuristic search techniques to generate software tests. The test adequacy criterion is transformed into a fitness function and a set of solutions in the search space are evaluated with respect to the fitness function using a metaheuristic search technique. The application of metaheuristic search techniques for testing is promising due to the fact that exhaustive testing is infeasible considering the size and complexity of software under test. Search-based software testing has been applied across the spectrum of test case design methods; this includes white-box (structural), black-box (functional) and grey-box (combination of structural and functional) testing. In addition, metaheuristic search techniques have also been applied to test non-functional properties. The overall objective of undertaking this systematic review is to examine existing work into non-functional search-based software testing (NFSBST). We are interested in types of non-functional testing targeted using metaheuristic search techniques, different fitness functions used in different types of search-based non-functional testing and challenges in the application of these techniques. The systematic review is based on a comprehensive set of 35 articles obtained after a multi-stage selection process and have been published in the time span 1996--2007. The results of the review show that metaheuristic search techniques have been applied for non-functional testing of execution time, quality of service, security, usability and safety. A variety of metaheuristic search techniques are found to be applicable for non-functional testing including simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, ant colony methods, grammatical evolution, genetic programming (and its variants including linear genetic programming) and swarm intelligence methods. The review reports on different fitness functions used to guide the search for each of the categories of execution time, safety, usability, quality of service and security; along with a discussion of possible challenges in the application of metaheuristic search techniques.},

	Abstract = {Context
Analogy-based Software development Effort Estimation (ASEE) techniques have gained considerable attention from the software engineering community. However, existing systematic map and review studies on software development effort prediction have not investigated in depth several issues of ASEE techniques, to the exception of comparisons with other types of estimation techniques.
Objective
The objective of this research is twofold: (1) to classify ASEE studies which primary goal is to propose new or modified ASEE techniques according to five criteria: research approach, contribution type, techniques used in combination with ASEE methods, and ASEE steps, as well as identifying publication channels and trends and (2) to analyze these studies from five perspectives: estimation accuracy, accuracy comparison, estimation context, impact of the techniques used in combination with ASEE methods, and ASEE tools.
Method
We performed a systematic mapping of studies for which the primary goal is to develop or to improve ASEE techniques published in the period 1990--2012, and reviewed them based on an automated search of four electronic databases.
Results
In total, we identified 65 studies published between 1990 and 2012, and classified them based on our predefined classification criteria. The mapping study revealed that most researchers focus on addressing problems related to the first step of an ASEE process, that is, feature and case subset selection. The results of our detailed analysis show that ASEE methods outperform the eight techniques with which they were compared, and tend to yield acceptable results especially when combining ASEE techniques with Fuzzy Logic (FL) or Genetic Algorithms (GA).
Conclusion
Based on the findings of this study, the use of other techniques such FL and GA in combination with an ASEE method is promising to generate more accurate estimates. However, the use of ASEE techniques by practitioners is still limited: developing more ASEE tools may facilitate the application of these techniques and then lead to increasing the use of ASEE techniques in industry.},

	Abstract = {Context
Knowledge management technologies have been employed across software engineering activities for more than two decades. Knowledge-based approaches can be used to facilitate software architecting activities (e.g., architectural evaluation). However, there is no comprehensive understanding on how various knowledge-based approaches (e.g., knowledge reuse) are employed in software architecture.
Objective
This work aims to collect studies on the application of knowledge-based approaches in software architecture and make a classification and thematic analysis on these studies, in order to identify the gaps in the existing application of knowledge-based approaches to various architecting activities, and promising research directions.
Method
A systematic mapping study is conducted for identifying and analyzing the application of knowledge-based approaches in software architecture, covering the papers from major databases, journals, conferences, and workshops, published between January 2000 and March 2011.
Results
Fifty-five studies were selected and classified according to the architecting activities they contribute to and the knowledge-based approaches employed. Knowledge capture and representation (e.g., using an ontology to describe architectural elements and their relationships) is the most popular approach employed in architecting activities. Knowledge recovery (e.g., documenting past architectural design decisions) is an ignored approach that is seldom used in software architecture. Knowledge-based approaches are mostly used in architectural evaluation, while receive the least attention in architecture impact analysis and architectural implementation.
Conclusions
The study results show an increased interest in the application of knowledge-based approaches in software architecture in recent years. A number of knowledge-based approaches, including knowledge capture and representation, reuse, sharing, recovery, and reasoning, have been employed in a spectrum of architecting activities. Knowledge-based approaches have been applied to a wide range of application domains, among which ``Embedded software'' has received the most attention.},

	Abstract = {Enhancing product quality might be a main goal of a software process improvement initiative (SPI). Quality is, however, a complex concept, and experts recommend identifying relevant product quality characteristics to satisfy users/customers' needs. There is thus a need to understand how SPI initiatives contribute to the improvement of software product quality characteristics. This paper aims to provide an overview of an up-to-date state-of-the-art regarding initiatives that focus on promoting product quality improvement by applying SPI approaches. This goal was achieved by conducting a systematic mapping study, as a result of which we identified 74 primary papers including both theoretical (75.7%) and empirical (24.3%) papers. The main product quality characteristics addressed are security, usability and reliability. Security-related process models, on the other hand, are those most cited (53%). The empirical papers suggest that traditional process reference models, such as CMM, CMMI or ISO 9001, moderately increase product quality characteristics, these principally being maintainability and reliability. However, there is a need for more empirical research to evaluate the impact of SPI initiatives on software product quality by considering contextual factors. SPI initiatives should be more driven by performance goals related to product quality characteristics.},

	Abstract = {Context
Model-driven code generation is being increasingly applied to enhance software development from perspectives of maintainability, extensibility and reusability. However, aspect-oriented code generation from models is an area that is currently underdeveloped.
Objective
In this study we provide a survey of existing research on aspect-oriented modeling and code generation to discover current work and identify needs for future research.
Method
A systematic mapping study was performed to find relevant studies. Classification schemes have been defined and the 65 selected primary studies have been classified on the basis of research focus, contribution type and research type.
Results
The papers of solution proposal research type are in a majority. All together aspect-oriented modeling appears being the most focused area divided into modeling notations and process (36%) and model composition and interaction management (26%). The majority of contributions are methods.
Conclusion
Aspect-oriented modeling and composition mechanisms have been significantly discussed in existing literature while more research is needed in the area of model-driven code generation. Furthermore, we have observed that previous research has frequently focused on proposing solutions and thus there is need for research that validates and evaluates the existing proposals in order to provide firm foundations for aspect-oriented model-driven code generation.},

	Abstract = {The automotive industry is going through a fundamental change by moving from a mechanical to a software-intensive industry in which most innovation and competition rely on software engineering competence. Over the last few decades, the importance of software engineering in the automotive industry has increased significantly and has attracted much attention from both scholars and practitioners. A large body-of-knowledge on automotive software engineering has accumulated in several scientific publications, yet there is no systematic analysis of that knowledge. This systematic mapping study aims to classify and analyze the literature related to automotive software engineering in order to provide a structured body-of-knowledge, identify well-established topics and potential research gaps. The review includes 679 articles from multiple research sub-area, published between 1990 and 2015. The primary studies were analyzed and classified with respect to five different dimensions. Furthermore, potential research gaps and recommendations for future research are presented. Three areas, namely system/software architecture and design, qualification testing, and reuse were the most frequently addressed topics in the literature. There were fewer comparative and validation studies, and the literature lacks practitioner-oriented guidelines. Overall, research activity on automotive software engineering seems to have high industrial relevance but is relatively lower in its scientific rigor.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Software maintenance starts as soon as the first artifacts are delivered and is essential for the success of the software. However, keeping maintenance activities and their related artifacts on track comes at a high cost. In this respect, change request (CR) repositories are fundamental in software maintenance. They facilitate the management of CRs and are also the central point to coordinate activities and communication among stakeholders. However, the benefits of CR repositories do not come without issues, and commonly occurring ones should be dealt with, such as the following: duplicate CRs, the large number of CRs to assign, or poorly described CRs. Such issues have led researchers to an increased interest in investigating CR repositories, by considering different aspects of software development and CR management. In this paper, we performed a systematic mapping study to characterize this research field. We analyzed 142 studies, which we classified in two ways. First, we classified the studies into different topics and grouped them into two dimensions: challenges and opportunities. Second, the challenge topics were classified in accordance with an existing taxonomy for information retrieval models. In addition, we investigated tools and services for CR management, to understand whether and how they addressed the topics identified. Copyright {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Context
Service-Orientation (SO) is a rapidly emerging paradigm for the design and development of adaptive and dynamic software systems. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) has also gained attention as a promising and successful software reuse development paradigm over the last decade and proven to provide effective solutions to deal with managing the growing complexity of software systems.
Objective
This study aims at characterizing and identifying the existing research on employing and leveraging SO and SPLE.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study to identify and analyze related literature. We identified 81 primary studies, dated from 2000--2011 and classified them with respect to research focus, types of research and contribution.
Result
The mapping synthesizes the available evidence about combining the synergy points and integration of SO and SPLE. The analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on service variability modeling and adaptive systems by employing SPLE principles and approaches. In particular, SPLE approaches, especially feature-oriented approaches for variability modeling, have been applied to the design and development of service-oriented systems. While SO is employed in software product line contexts for the realization of product lines to reconcile the flexibility, scalability and dynamism in product derivations thereby creating dynamic software product lines.
Conclusion
Our study summarizes and characterizes the SO and SPLE topics researchers have investigated over the past decade and identifies promising research directions as due to the synergy generated by integrating methods and techniques from these two areas.},

	Abstract = {Context
Software documentation is an integral part of any software development process. Researchers and practitioners have expressed concerns about costs, benefits and quality of software documentation in practice. On the one hand, there is a lack of a comprehensive model to evaluate the quality of documentation. On the other hand, researchers and practitioners need to assess whether documentation cost outweighs its benefit.
Objectives
In this study, we aim to summarize the existing literature and provide an overview of the field of software documentation cost, benefit and quality.
Method
We use the systematic-mapping methodology to map the existing body of knowledge related to software documentation cost, benefit and quality. To achieve our objectives, 11 Research Questions (RQ) are raised. The primary papers are carefully selected. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, our study pool included a set of 69 papers from 1971 to 2011. A systematic map is developed and refined iteratively.
Results
We present the results of a systematic mapping covering different research aspects related to software documentation cost, benefit and quality (RQ 1--11). Key findings include: (1) validation research papers are dominating (27 papers), followed by solution proposals (21 papers). (2) Most papers (61 out of 69) do not mention the development life-cycle model explicitly. Agile development is only mentioned in 6 papers. (3) Most papers include only one ``System under Study'' (SUS) which is mostly academic prototype. The average number of participants in survey-based papers is 106, the highest one having approximately 1000 participants. (4) In terms of focus of papers, 50 papers focused on documentation quality, followed by 37 papers on benefit, and 12 papers on documentation cost. (5) The quality attributes of documentation that appear in most papers are, in order: completeness, consistency and accessibility. Additionally, improved meta-models for documentation cost, benefit and quality are also presented. Furthermore, we have created an online paper repository of the primary papers analyzed and mapped during this study.
Conclusion
Our study results show that this research area is emerging but far from mature. Firstly, documentation cost aspect seems to have been neglected in the existing literature and there are no systematic methods or models to measure cost. Also, despite a substantial number of solutions proposed during the last 40 years, more and stronger empirical evidences are still needed to enhance our understanding of this area. In particular, what we expect includes (1) more validation or evaluation studies; (2) studies involving large-scale development projects, or from large number of study participants of various organizations; (3) more industry-academia collaborations; (4) more estimation models or methods to assess documentation quality, benefit and, especially, cost.},

	Abstract = {As part of the innovation process, creativity has become a critical dimension for organizations that wish to maintain their competitiveness. In order to foster the creativity potential within organizations, processes and systems need to be designed and integrated so that all stakeholders can participate in a coordinated and timely fashion, and despite the various dispersion levels that may separate them. Although many tools are already available on the market or being tested, a significant gap still exists between those products and the creativity process that they are supposed to support. To truly respond to the need for creativity in a distributed environment, it is suggested that the entire process be re-examined and understood so that future Creativity Support Systems can fulfil real needs. This paper is a systematic mapping study of the literature on existing digital tools dedicated to creativity. A thorough examination of over 49 digital tools is carried out, providing the action channel for emerging Creativity Support Systems that would better support collaboration diversity throughout the creative process.},

	Abstract = {Context: Crowdsourcing, or tapping into the power of the crowd for problem solving, has gained ever-increasing attraction since it was first introduced. Crowdsourcing has been used in different disciplines, and it is becoming well-accepted in the marketplace as a new business model which utilizes Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). Objective: While both academia and industry have extensively delved into different aspects of crowdsourcing, there seems to be no common understanding of what crowdsourcing really means and what core and optional features it has. Also, we still lack information on the kinds and disciplines of studies conducted on crowdsourcing and how they defined it in the context of their application area. This paper will clarify this ambiguity by analysing the distribution and demographics of research in crowdsourcing and extracting taxonomy of the variability and commonality in the constructs defining the concept in the literature. Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study and analyse 113 papers, selected via a formal process, and report and discuss the results. The study is combined by a content analysis process to extract a taxonomy of features describing crowdsourcing. Results: We extract and describe the taxonomy of features which characterize crowdsourcing in its four constituents; the crowd, the crowdsourcer, the crowdsourced task and the crowdsourcing platform. In addition, we report on different mappings between these features and the characteristics of the studied papers. We also analyse the distribution of the research using multiple criteria and draw conclusions. For example, our results show a constantly increasing interest in the area, especially in North America and a significant interest from industry. Also, we illustrate that although crowdsourcing is shown to be useful in a variety of disciplines, the research in the field of computer science still seems to be dominant in investigating it. Conclusions: This study allows forming a clear picture of the research in crowdsourcing and understanding the different features of crowdsourcing and their popularity, what type of research was conducted, where and how and by whom. The study enables researchers and practitioners to estimate the current status of the research in this new field. Our taxonomy of extracted features provides a reference model which could be used to configure crowdsourcing and also define it precisely and make design decisions on which of its variation to adopt.},

	Abstract = {Software as a service is frequently offered in a multi-tenant style, where customers of the application and their end-users share resources such as software and hardware among all users, without necessarily sharing data. It is surprising that, with such a popular paradigm, little agreement exists with regard to the definition, domain, and challenges of multi-tenancy. This absence is detrimental to the research community and the industry, as it hampers progress in the domain of multi-tenancy and enables organizations and academics to wield their own definitions to further their commercial or research agendas. In this article, a systematic mapping study on multi-tenancy is described in which 761 academic papers and 371 industrial blogs are analysed. Both the industrial and academic perspective are assessed, in order to get a complete overview. The definition and topic maps provide a comprehensive overview of the domain, while the research agenda, listing four important research topics, provides a roadmap for future research efforts.},

@article{Ameller:2015,
	Abstract = {Context
Model-Driven Development (MDD) and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) are two challenging research areas in software engineering. MDD is about improving software development whilst SOA is a service-based conceptual development style, therefore investigating the available proposals in the literature to use MDD when developing SOA may be insightful. However, no studies have been found with this purpose.
Objective
This work aims at assessing the state of the art in MDD for SOA systems. It mainly focuses on: what are the characteristics of MDD approaches that support SOA; what types of SOA are supported; how do they handle non-functional requirements.
Method
We conducted a mapping study following a rigorous protocol. We identified the representative set of venues that should be included in the study. We applied a search string over the set of selected venues. As result, 129 papers were selected and analysed (both frequency analysis and correlation analysis) with respect to the defined classification criteria derived from the research questions. Threats to validity were identified and mitigated whenever possible.
Results
The analysis allows us to answer the research questions. We highlight: (1) predominance of papers from Europe and written by researchers only; (2) predominance of top-down transformation in software development activities; (3) inexistence of consolidated methods; (4) significant percentage of works without tool support; (5) SOA systems and service compositions more targeted than single services and SOA enterprise systems; (6) limited use of metamodels; (7) very limited use of NFRs; and (8) limited application in real cases.
Conclusion
This mapping study does not just provide the state of the art in the topic, but also identifies several issues that deserve investigation in the future, for instance the need of methods for activities other than software development (e.g., migration) or the need of conducting more real case studies.},

	Abstract = {Context: In this study we report on a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) for Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), based on an automatic search including primary studies from journals, conferences, and workshops during the period from 2006 until 2012. Objective: The main objective of the described work was to perform an SMS on DSLs to better understand the DSL research field, identify research trends, and any possible open issues. The set of research questions was inspired by a DSL survey paper published in 2005. Method: We conducted a SMS over 5 stages: defining research questions, conducting the search, screening, classifying, and data extraction. Our SMS included 1153 candidate primary studies from the ISI Web of Science and ACM Digital Library, 390 primary studies were classified after screening. Results: This SMS discusses two main research questions: research space and trends/demographics of the literature within the field of DSLs. Both research questions are further subdivided into several research sub-questions. The results from the first research question clearly show that the DSL community focuses more on the development of new techniques/methods rather than investigating the integrations of DSLs with other software engineering processes or measuring the effectiveness of DSL approaches. Furthermore, there is a clear lack of evaluation research. Amongst different DSL development phases more attention is needed in regard to domain analysis, validation, and maintenance. The second research question revealed that the number of publications remains stable, and has not increased over the years. Top cited papers and venues are mentioned, as well as identifying the more active institutions carrying DSL research. Conclusion: The statistical findings regarding research questions paint an interesting picture about the mainstreams of the DSL community, as well as open issues where researchers can improve their research in their future work.},

@article{Fernandez_Saez:2013,
	Abstract = {Context
The Unified Modelling Language (UML) has, after ten years, become established as the de facto standard for the modelling of object-oriented software systems. It is therefore relevant to investigate whether its use is important as regards the costs involved in its implantation in industry being worthwhile.
Method
We have carried out a systematic mapping study to collect the empirical studies published in order to discover ``What is the current existing empirical evidence with regard to the use of UML diagrams in source code maintenance and the maintenance of the UML diagrams themselves?
Results
We found 38 papers, which contained 63 experiments and 3 case studies.
Conclusion
Although there is common belief that the use of UML is beneficial for source code maintenance, since the quality of the modifications is greater when UML diagrams are available, only 3 papers concerning this issue have been published. Most research (60 empirical studies) concerns the maintainability and comprehensibility of the UML diagrams themselves which form part of the system's documentation, since it is assumed that they may influence source code maintainability, although this has not been empirically validated. Moreover, the generalizability of the majority of the experiments is questionable given the material, tasks and subjects used. There is thus a need for more experiments and case studies to be performed in industrial contexts, i.e., with real systems and using maintenance tasks conducted by practitioners under real conditions that truly show the utility of UML diagrams in maintaining code, and that the fact that a diagram is more comprehensible or modifiable influences the maintainability of the code itself. This utility should also be studied from the viewpoint of cost and productivity, and the consistent and simultaneous maintenance of diagrams and code must also be considered in future empirical studies.},

@article{Giuffrida:2013,
	Abstract = {Background
In Global Software Development (GSD), informal communication and knowledge sharing play an important role. Social Software (SoSo) has the potential to support and foster this key responsibility. Research on the use of SoSo in GSD is still at an early stage: although a number of empirical studies on the usage of SoSo are available in related fields, there exists no comprehensive overview of what has been investigated to date across them.
Objective
The aim of this review is to map empirical studies on the usage of SoSo in Software Engineering projects and in distributed teams, and to highlight the findings of research works which could prove to be beneficial for GSD researchers and practitioners.
Method
A Systematic Mapping Study is conducted using a broad search string that allows identifying a variety of studies which can be beneficial for GSD. Papers have been retrieved through a combination of automatic search and snowballing, hence a wide quantitative map of the research area is provided. Additionally, text extracts from the studies are qualitatively synthesised to investigate benefits and challenges of the use of SoSo.
Results
SoSo is reported as being chiefly used as a support for collaborative work, fostering awareness, knowledge management and coordination among team members. Contrary to the evident high importance of the social aspects offered by SoSo, socialisation is not the most important usage reported.
Conclusions
This review reports how SoSo is used in GSD and how it is capable of supporting GSD teams. Four emerging themes in global software engineering were identified: the appropriation and development of usage structures; understanding how an ecology of communication channels and tools are used by teams; the role played by SoSo either as a subtext or as an explicit goal; and finally, the surprising low percentage of observational studies.},

	Abstract = {The entity reconciliation (ER) problem aroused much interest as a research topic in today's Big Data era, full of big and open heterogeneous data sources. This problem poses when relevant information on a topic needs to be obtained using methods based on: (i) identifying records that represent the same real world entity, and (ii) identifying those records that are similar but do not correspond to the same real-world entity. ER is an operational intelligence process, whereby organizations can unify different and heterogeneous data sources in order to relate possible matches of non-obvious entities. Besides, the complexity that the heterogeneity of data sources involves, the large number of records and differences among languages, for instance, must be added. This paper describes a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) of journal articles, conferences and workshops published from 2010 to 2017 to solve the problem described before, first trying to understand the state-of-the-art, and then identifying any gaps in current research. Eleven digital libraries were analyzed following a systematic, semiautomatic and rigorous process that has resulted in 61 primary studies. They represent a great variety of intelligent proposals that aim to solve ER. The conclusion obtained is that most of the research is based on the operational phase as opposed to the design phase, and most studies have been tested on real-world data sources, where a lot of them are heterogeneous, but just a few apply to industry. There is a clear trend in research techniques based on clustering/blocking and graphs, although the level of automation of the proposals is hardly ever mentioned in the research work.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we present a systematic mapping study of research on personality in software engineering. The goal is to plot the landscape of current published empirical and theoretical studies that deal with the role of personality in software engineering. We applied the systematic review method to search and select published articles, and to extract and synthesize data from the selected articles that reported studies about personality. Our search retrieved more than 19,000 articles, from which we selected 90 articles published between 1970 and 2010. Nearly 72% of the studies were published after 2002 and 83% of the studies reported empirical research findings. Data extracted from the 90 studies showed that education and pair programming were the most recurring research topics, and that MBTI was the most used test. Research related to pair programming, education, team effectiveness, software process allocation, software engineer personality characteristics, and individual performance concentrated over 88% of the studies, while team process, behavior and preferences, and leadership performance were the topics with the smallest number of studies. We conclude that the number of articles has grown in the last few years, but contradictory evidence was found that might have been caused by differences in context, research method, and versions of the tests used in the studies. While this raises a warning for practitioners that wish to use personality tests in practice, it shows several opportunities for the research community to improve and extend findings in this field.},

	Abstract = {Context
Gamification seeks for improvement of the user's engagement, motivation, and performance when carrying out a certain task, by means of incorporating game mechanics and elements, thus making that task more attractive. Much research work has studied the application of gamification in software engineering for increasing the engagement and results of developers.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic mapping of the field of gamification in software engineering in an attempt to characterize the state of the art of this field identifying gaps and opportunities for further research.
Method
We carried out a systematic mapping with a view to finding the primary studies in the existing literature, which were later classified and analyzed according to four criteria: the software process area addressed, the gamification elements used, the type of research method followed, and the type of forum in which they were published. A subjective evaluation of the studies was also carried out to evaluate them in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, integration with the organization, and replicability.
Results
As a result of the systematic mapping we found 29 primary studies, published between January 2011 and June 2014. Most of them focus on software development, and to a lesser extent, requirements, project management, and other support areas. In the main, they consider very simple gamification mechanics such as points and badges, and few provide empirical evidence of the impact of gamification.
Conclusions
Existing research in the field is quite preliminary, and more research effort analyzing the impact of gamification in SE would be needed. Future research work should look at other game mechanics in addition to the basic ones and should tackle software process areas that have not been fully studied, such as requirements, project management, maintenance, or testing. Most studies share a lack of methodological support that would make their proposals replicable in other settings. The integration of gamification with an organization's existing tools is also an important challenge that needs to be taken up in this field.},

@article{Banerjee:2013,
	Abstract = {Context
GUI testing is system testing of a software that has a graphical-user interface (GUI) front-end. Because system testing entails that the entire software system, including the user interface, be tested as a whole, during GUI testing, test cases---modeled as sequences of user input events---are developed and executed on the software by exercising the GUI's widgets (e.g., text boxes and clickable buttons). More than 230 articles have appeared in the area of GUI testing since 1991.
Objective
In this paper, we study this existing body of knowledge using a systematic mapping (SM).
Method
The SM is conducted using the guidelines proposed by Petersen et al. We pose three sets of research questions. We define selection and exclusion criteria. From the initial pool of 230 articles, published in years 1991--2011, our final pool consisted of 136 articles. We systematically develop a classification scheme and map the selected articles to this scheme.
Results
We present two types of results. First, we report the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain, including: top-cited articles, active researchers, top venues, and active countries in this research area. Moreover, we derive the trends, for instance, in terms of types of articles, sources of information to derive test cases, types of evaluations used in articles, etc. Our second major result is a publicly-accessible repository that contains all our mapping data. We plan to update this repository on a regular basis, making it a ``live'' resource for all researchers.
Conclusion
Our SM provides an overview of existing GUI testing approaches and helps spot areas in the field that require more attention from the research community. For example, much work is needed to connect academic model-based techniques with commercially available tools. To this end, studies are needed to compare the state-of-the-art in GUI testing in academic techniques and industrial tools.},

	Abstract = {Context
Software patterns encapsulate expert knowledge for constructing successful solutions to recurring problems. Although a large collection of software patterns is available in literature, empirical evidence on how well various patterns help in problem solving is limited and inconclusive. The context of these empirical findings is also not well understood, limiting applicability and generalizability of the findings.
Objective
To characterize the research design of empirical studies exploring software pattern application involving human participants.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study to identify and analyze 30 primary empirical studies on software pattern application, including 24 original studies and 6 replications. We characterize the research design in terms of the questions researchers have explored and the context of empirical research efforts. We also classify the studies in terms of measures used for evaluation, and threats to validity considered during study design and execution.
Results
Use of software patterns in maintenance is the most commonly investigated theme, explored in 16 studies. Object-oriented design patterns are evaluated in 14 studies while 4 studies evaluate architectural patterns. We identified 10 different constructs with 31 associated measures used to evaluate software patterns. Measures for `efficiency' and `usability' are commonly used to evaluate the problem solving process. While measures for `completeness', `correctness' and `quality' are commonly used to evaluate the final artifact. Overall, `time to complete a task' is the most frequently used measure, employed in 15 studies to measure `efficiency'. For qualitative measures, studies do not report approaches for minimizing biases 27% of the time. Nine studies do not discuss any threats to validity.
Conclusion
Subtle differences in study design and execution can limit comparison of findings. Establishing baselines for participants' experience level, providing appropriate training, standardizing problem sets, and employing commonly used measures to evaluate performance can support replication and comparison of results across studies.},

	Abstract = {Context
The technical debt metaphor describes the effect of immature artifacts on software maintenance that bring a short-term benefit to the project in terms of increased productivity and lower cost, but that may have to be paid off with interest later. Much research has been performed to propose mechanisms to identify debt and decide the most appropriate moment to pay it off. It is important to investigate the current state of the art in order to provide both researchers and practitioners with information that enables further research activities as well as technical debt management in practice.
Objective
This paper has the following goals: to characterize the types of technical debt, identify indicators that can be used to find technical debt, identify management strategies, understand the maturity level of each proposal, and identify what visualization techniques have been proposed to support technical debt identification and management activities.
Method
A systematic mapping study was performed based on a set of three research questions. In total, 100 studies, dated from 2010 to 2014, were evaluated.
Results
We proposed an initial taxonomy of technical debt types, created a list of indicators that have been proposed to identify technical debt, identified the existing management strategies, and analyzed the current state of art on technical debt, identifying topics where new research efforts can be invested.
Conclusion
The results of this mapping study can help to identify points that still require further investigation in technical debt research.},

Search-based algorithms have been successfully applied to solve software engineering problems in the field known as Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE). However, in practice, the user may reject the obtained solutions, since many characteristics of the problem cannot be mathematically modeled. To cope with this situation, preference-based algorithms have been investigated and raised interest in the SBSE field.
Objective
To identify the quantity and type of research on SBSE preference-based approaches and to contribute to this new research subject, named here Preference and Search-Based Software Engineering (PSBSE),
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping, following a research plan to locate, assess, extract and group the outcomes from relevant studies.
Results
Few software engineering activities have been addressed. The most used algorithms are evolutionary and single-objective. In most studies the preferences are provided interactively and, in many cases, the user preferences are incorporated in the fitness functions. We observe a lack of evaluation measures and works comparing existing approaches.
Conclusions
The use of preference-based algorithms in SBSE is an underexplored subject, and many research opportunities exist.},

	Abstract = {Background: Emergency management (EM) refers to the ability to deal with emergency tasks in different phases and iterations. To do this, each task requires many and different types of information coming from several sources related to the incident. As people working in an emergency situation are generally under stress and have to make quick and effective decisions, they need to assimilate the received information in an easy and intuitive way. Information visualization (InfoVis) is the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition to understand these data through 2D computer screens. It is frequently used to analyze and understand the huge amount of multidimensional data produced in an emergency. Objective: This study analyzes how researchers use information visualization tools to improve emergency management. Our general objective is to map the area examining both the scientific community and the contributions that have been published in the literature, aiming to provide information, such as: understanding how the area is structured, common practices in existing works, and research gaps. Methods: A systematic mapping study was conducted to analyze the available information visualization tools and their applications in EM activities. A thorough search was carried out and a formal selection process was applied to gather all relevant articles on the subject. Selected primary studies were classified and analyzed with respect to their metadata and to answer eight research questions related to our mapping goal. In total, 196 studies were analyzed in depth. Results: The mapping study identified the most common visualization techniques applied in emergency management, the common environments and phases where they are applied, identifying gaps and also possible trends in the subject. We found out that particular issues concerning emergency management are not fully covered by existing visualization approaches, and when covered, existing literature provides only partial solutions. Conclusion: Our results provide a deep analysis on the application of InfoVis in the EM area, supporting researchers and developers in EM systems with insightful information on trending techniques in use, command practices and existing research gaps. We expect that these findings can support them on proposing new approaches to solve open problems in the area.},

	Abstract = {Context
Two recent mapping studies which were intended to verify the current state of replication of empirical studies in Software Engineering (SE) identified two sets of studies: empirical studies actually reporting replications (published between 1994 and 2012) and a second group of studies that are concerned with definitions, classifications, processes, guidelines, and other research topics or themes about replication work in empirical software engineering research (published between 1996 and 2012).
Objective
In this current article, our goal is to analyze and discuss the contents of the second set of studies about replications to increase our understanding of the current state of the work on replication in empirical software engineering research.
Method
We applied the systematic literature review method to build a systematic mapping study, in which the primary studies were collected by two previous mapping studies covering the period 1996--2012 complemented by manual and automatic search procedures that collected articles published in 2013.
Results
We analyzed 37 papers reporting studies about replication published in the last 17years. These papers explore different topics related to concepts and classifications, presented guidelines, and discuss theoretical issues that are relevant for our understanding of replication in our field. We also investigated how these 37 papers have been cited in the 135 replication papers published between 1994 and 2012.
Conclusions
Replication in SE still lacks a set of standardized concepts and terminology, which has a negative impact on the replication work in our field. To improve this situation, it is important that the SE research community engage on an effort to create and evaluate taxonomy, frameworks, guidelines, and methodologies to fully support the development of replications.},

Software testing is a knowledge intensive process, and, thus, Knowledge Management (KM) principles and techniques should be applied to manage software testing knowledge.
Objective
This study conducts a survey on existing research on KM initiatives in software testing, in order to identify the state of the art in the area as well as the future research. Aspects such as purposes, types of knowledge, technologies and research type are investigated.
Method
The mapping study was performed by searching seven electronic databases. We considered studies published until December 2013. The initial resulting set was comprised of 562 studies. From this set, a total of 13 studies were selected. For these 13, we performed snowballing and direct search to publications of researchers and research groups that accomplished these studies.
Results
From the mapping study, we identified 15 studies addressing KM initiatives in software testing that have been reviewed in order to extract relevant information on a set of research questions.
Conclusions
Although only a few studies were found that addressed KM initiatives in software testing, the mapping shows an increasing interest in the topic in the recent years. Reuse of test cases is the perspective that has received more attention. From the KM point of view, most of the studies discuss aspects related to providing automated support for managing testing knowledge by means of a KM system. Moreover, as a main conclusion, the results show that KM is pointed out as an important strategy for increasing test effectiveness, as well as for improving the selection and application of suited techniques, methods and test cases. On the other hand, inadequacy of existing KM systems appears as the most cited problem related to applying KM in software testing.},

	Abstract = {Context
Software productivity measurement is essential in order to control and improve the performance of software development. For example, by identifying role models (e.g. projects, individuals, tasks) when comparing productivity data. The prediction is of relevance to determine whether corrective actions are needed, and to discover which alternative improvement action would yield the best results.
Objective
In this study we identify studies for software productivity prediction and measurement. Based on the identified studies we first create a classification scheme and map the studies into the scheme (systematic map). Thereafter, a detailed analysis and synthesis of the studies is conducted.
Method
As a research method for systematically identifying and aggregating the evidence of productivity measurement and prediction approaches systematic mapping and systematic review have been used.
Results
In total 38 studies have been identified, resulting in a classification scheme for empirical research on software productivity. The mapping allowed to identify the rigor of the evidence with respect to the different productivity approaches. In the detailed analysis the results were tabulated and synthesized to provide recommendations to practitioners.
Conclusion
Risks with simple ratio-based measurement approaches were shown. In response to the problems data envelopment analysis seems to be a strong approach to capture multivariate productivity measures, and allows to identify reference projects to which inefficient projects should be compared. Regarding simulation no general prediction model can be identified. Simulation and statistical process control are promising methods for software productivity prediction. Overall, further evidence is needed to make stronger claims and recommendations. In particular, the discussion of validity threats should become standard, and models need to be compared with each other.},

Objective: In this paper, we prepare a survey of primary studies on MDWE to explore current work and identify needs for future research. Method: Systematic mapping study uses for finding the most relevant studies and classification. In this study, we found 289 papers and a classification scheme divided them depending on their research focus, contribution type and research type. Results: The papers of solution proposal (20%) research type are majority. The most focused areas of MDWE appear to be: Web Applicability (31%), Molding and Notation (19%), and Services and Oriented (18%). The majority of contributions are methods (33%). Moreover, this shows MDWE as a wide, new, and active area to publications. Conclusions: Whilst additional analysis is warranted within the MDWE scope, in literature, composition mechanisms have been thoroughly discoursed. Furthermore, we have witnessed that the recurrent recommendation for Validation Research, Solution Proposal and Philosophical Papers has been done through earlier analysis.},

@article{Nguyen:2017,
	Abstract = {Context
Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have emerged to be the next generation of engineered systems driving the so-called fourth industrial revolution. CPSs are becoming more complex, open and more prone to security threats, which urges security to be engineered systematically into CPSs. Model-Based Security Engineering (MBSE) could be a key means to tackle this challenge via security by design, abstraction, and automation.
Objective
We aim at providing an initial assessment of the state of the art in MBSE for CPSs (MBSE4CPS). Specifically, this work focuses on finding out 1) the publication statistics of MBSE4CPS studies; 2) the characteristics of MBSE4CPS studies; and 3) the open issues of MBSE4CPS research.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) following a rigorous protocol that was developed based on the state-of-the-art SMS and systematic review guidelines. From thousands of relevant publications, we systematically identified 48 primary MBSE4CPS studies for data extraction and synthesis to answer predefined research questions.
Results
SMS results show that for three recent years (2014--2016) the number of primary MBSE4CPS studies has increased significantly. Within the primary studies, the popularity of using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is comparable with the use of the standardised UML modelling notation. Most primary studies do not explicitly address specific security concerns (e.g., confidentiality, integrity) but rather focus on security analyses in general on threats, attacks or vulnerabilities. Few primary studies propose to engineer security solutions for CPSs. Many focus on the early stages of development lifecycle such as security requirement engineering or analysis.
Conclusion
The SMS does not only provide the state of the art in MBSE4CPS, but also points out several open issues that would deserve more investigation, e.g., the lack of engineering security solutions for CPSs, limited tool support, too few industrial case studies, and the challenge of bridging DSLs in engineering secure CPSs.},

@article{Cavalcante:2016,
	Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm relying on the interaction of smart objects (things) with each other and with physical and/or virtual resources through the Internet. Despite the recent advances that have made IoT a reality, there are several challenges to be addressed towards exploiting its full potential and promoting tangible benefits to society, environment, economy, and individual citizens. Recently, Cloud Computing has been advocated as a promising approach to tackle some of the existing challenges in IoT while leveraging its adoption and bringing new opportunities. With the combination of IoT and Cloud Computing, the cloud becomes an intermediate layer between smart objects and applications that make use of data and resources provided by these objects. On the one hand, IoT can benefit from the almost unlimited resources of Cloud Computing to implement management and composition of services related to smart objects and their provided data. On the other hand, the cloud can benefit from IoT by broadening its operation scope to deal with real-world objects. In spite of this synergy, the literature still lacks of a broad, comprehensive overview on what has been investigated on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing and what are the open issues to be addressed in future research and development. The goal of this work is to fill this gap by systematically collecting and analyzing studies available in the literature aiming to: (i) obtain a comprehensive understanding on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing paradigms; (ii) provide an overview of the current state of research on this topic; and (iii) identify important gaps in the existing approaches as well as promising research directions. To achieve this goal, a systematic mapping study was performed covering papers recently published in journals, conferences, and workshops, available at five relevant electronic databases. As a result, 35 studies were selected presenting strategies and solutions on how to integrate IoT and Cloud Computing as well as scenarios, research challenges, and opportunities in this context. Besides confirming the increasing interest on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing, this paper reports the main outcomes of the performed systematic mapping by both presenting an overview of the state of the art on the investigated topic and shedding light on important challenges and potential directions to future research.},

	Abstract = {Context
The software architecture of a system is the result of a set of architectural decisions. The topic of architectural decisions in software engineering has received significant attention in recent years. However, no systematic overview exists on the state of research on architectural decisions.
Objective
The goal of this study is to provide a systematic overview of the state of research on architectural decisions. Such an overview helps researchers reflect on previous research and plan future research. Furthermore, such an overview helps practitioners understand the state of research, and how research results can help practitioners in their architectural decision-making.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study, covering studies published between January 2002 and January 2012. We defined six research questions. We queried six reference databases and obtained an initial result set of 28,895 papers. We followed a search and filtering process that resulted in 144 relevant papers.
Results
After classifying the 144 relevant papers for each research question, we found that current research focuses on documenting architectural decisions. We found that only several studies describe architectural decisions from the industry. We identified potential future research topics: domain-specific architectural decisions (such as mobile), achieving specific quality attributes (such as reliability or scalability), uncertainty in decision-making, and group architectural decisions. Regarding empirical evaluations of the papers, around half of the papers use systematic empirical evaluation approaches (such as surveys, or case studies). Still, few papers on architectural decisions use experiments.
Conclusion
Our study confirms the increasing interest in the topic of architectural decisions. This study helps the community reflect on the past ten years of research on architectural decisions. Researchers are offered a number of promising future research directions, while practitioners learn what existing papers offer.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT In this paper, an approach for information systems reverse engineering is proposed and applied. The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications. Copyright {\copyright} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Software ecosystems are becoming a common model for software development in which different actors cooperate around a shared platform. However, it is not clear what the implications are on software quality when moving from a traditional approach to an ecosystem, and this is becoming increasingly important as ecosystems emerge in critical domains such as embedded applications. Therefore, this paper investigates the challenges related to quality assurance in software ecosystems, and identifies what approaches have been proposed in the literature. The research method used is a systematic literature mapping, which however only resulted in a small set of six papers. The literature findings are complemented with a constructive approach where areas are identified that merit further research, resulting in a set of research topics that form a research agenda for quality assurance in software ecosystems. The agenda spans the entire system life-cycle, and focuses on challenges particular to an ecosystem setting, which are mainly the results of the interactions across organizational borders, and the dynamic system integration being controlled by the users.},

@article{Garces:2017,
	Abstract = {Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.},

	Abstract = {Context: Cloud computing is a new computing technology that provides services to consumers and businesses. Due to the increasing use of these services, the quality of service (QoS) of cloud computing has become an important and essential issue since there are many open challenges which need to be addressed related to trust in cloud services. Many research issues have been proposed in QoS approaches in the cloud computing area. Objective: The aim of this study is to survey current research on QoS approaches in cloud computing in order to identify where more emphasis should be placed in both current and future research directions. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed to find the related literature, and 67 articles were selected as primary studies that are classified in relation to the focus, research type and contribution type. Result: The majority of the articles are of the validation research type (64%). Infrastructure as a service (48%) was the largest research focus area, followed by software as a service (36%). The majority of contributions concerned methods (48%), followed by models (32%). Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that QoS approaches in cloud computing have become an important topic in the cloud computing area in recent years and there remain open challenges and gaps which require future research exploration. In particular, tools, metrics and evaluation research are needed in order to provide useful and trustworthy cloud computing services that deliver appropriate QoS.},

	Abstract = {CONTEXT. Software Product Lines (SPLs) aim to support the development of a whole family of software products through systematic reuse of shared assets. As SPLs exhibit a long life-span, evolution is an even greater concern than for single-systems. For the purpose of this work, evolution refers to the adaptation of the SPL as a result of changing requirements. Hence, evolution is triggered by requirement changes, and not by bug fixing or refactoring. OBJECTIVE. Research on SPL evolution has not been previously mapped. This work provides a mapping study along Petersen's and Kichenham's guidelines, to identify strong areas of knowledge, trends and gaps. RESULTS. We identified 107 relevant contributions. They were classified according to four facets: evolution activity (e.g., identify, analyze and plan, implement), product-derivation approach (e.g., annotation-based, composition-based), research type (e.g., solution, experience, evaluation), and asset type (i.e., variability model, SPL architecture, code assets and products). CONCLUSION. Analyses of the results indicate that ``Solution proposals'' are the most common type of contribution (31%). Regarding the evolution activity, ``Implement change'' (43%) and ``Analyze and plan change'' (37%) are the most covered ones. A finer-grained analysis uncovered some tasks as being underexposed. A detailed description of the 107 papers is also included.},

	Abstract = {Design patterns are used in software development to provide reusable and documented solutions to common design problems. Although many studies have explored various aspects of design patterns, no research summarizing the state of research related to design patterns existed up to now. This paper presents the results of a mapping study of about 120 primary studies, to provide an overview of the research efforts on Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns. The research questions of this study deal with (a) if design pattern research can be further categorized in research subtopics, (b) which of the above subtopics are the most active ones and (c) what is the reported effect of GoF patterns on software quality attributes. The results suggest that design pattern research can be further categorized to research on GoF patterns formalization, detection and application and on the effect of GoF patterns on software quality attributes. Concerning the intensity of research activity of the abovementioned subtopics, research on pattern detection and on the effect of GoF patterns on software quality attributes appear to be the most active ones. Finally, the reported research to date on the effect of GoF patterns on software quality attributes are controversial; because some studies identify one pattern's effect as beneficial whereas others report the same pattern's effect as harmful.},

	Abstract = {Serious games are games with an educational purpose. In these games, players develop their skills by facing a number of challenges, and students are assessed according to their game playing behaviour. Assessment of serious game-based learning experiences has to take into account diverse features as game genre, pedagogical aim or game context. This paper analyses how skills are usually assessed in learning experiences based on serious games. To reach this objective, a systematic mapping study of more than 400 papers is undertaken. Papers were identified and classified according to a framework based on four categories: assessment aim, implementation, integration and primary assessment type. The reviewed literature mainly deals with contributions on methods and approaches for serious games. Results have revealed that most assessment methods are applied for a formative purpose more than for a certification purpose. Most frequent implementations such as game scoring and integrations like monitoring states were also uncovered. The main primary type of assessment detected was in-process. In addition, several limitations were found in the assessment methods: regarding the aim of assessment, certification of previous or attained skills was usually implemented out of the game; the scope of some implementations was limited because results were predefined earlier; and most of methods analysed present scalability issues because they rely on manual assessments. Such findings are analysed and discussed to clarify the state of the art and provide recommendations for further work in the area of serious games-based learning.},

	Abstract = {There is a continual growth in the use of social computing within a breadth of business domains; such as marketing, public engagement and innovation management. Software engineering research, like other similar disciplines, has recently started to harness the power of social computing throughout the various development phases; from requirements elicitation to validation and maintenance and for the various methods of development and structures of development teams. However, despite this increasing effort, we still lack a clear picture of the current status of this research. To address that lack of knowledge, we conduct a systematic mapping study on the utilisation of social computing for software engineering. This will inform researchers and practitioners about the current status and progress of the field including the areas of current focus and the geographical and chronological distribution of the research. We do the mapping across a diversity of dimensions including the activities of software engineering, the types of research, the characteristics of social computing and the demographic attributes of the published work. Our study results show a growing interest in the field, mainly in academia, and a general trend towards developing designated social computing platforms and utilising them in mainly four software engineering areas: management, coding, requirements engineering, and maintenance and enhancement.},

	Abstract = {Context
Software startups are newly created companies with no operating history and fast in producing cutting-edge technologies. These companies develop software under highly uncertain conditions, tackling fast-growing markets under severe lack of resources. Therefore, software startups present a unique combination of characteristics which pose several challenges to software development activities.
Objective
This study aims to structure and analyze the literature on software development in startup companies, determining thereby the potential for technology transfer and identifying software development work practices reported by practitioners and researchers.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study, developing a classification schema, ranking the selected primary studies according their rigor and relevance, and analyzing reported software development work practices in startups.
Results
A total of 43 primary studies were identified and mapped, synthesizing the available evidence on software development in startups. Only 16 studies are entirely dedicated to software development in startups, of which 10 result in a weak contribution (advice and implications (6); lesson learned (3); tool (1)). Nineteen studies focus on managerial and organizational factors. Moreover, only 9 studies exhibit high scientific rigor and relevance. From the reviewed primary studies, 213 software engineering work practices were extracted, categorized and analyzed.
Conclusion
This mapping study provides the first systematic exploration of the state-of-art on software startup research. The existing body of knowledge is limited to a few high quality studies. Furthermore, the results indicate that software engineering work practices are chosen opportunistically, adapted and configured to provide value under the constrains imposed by the startup context.},

	Abstract = {Background
Software evolution is an important topic in software engineering. It generally deals with large amounts of data, as one must look at whole project histories as opposed to their current snapshot. Software visualization is the field of software engineering that aims to help people to understand software through the use of visual resources. It can be effectively used to analyze and understand the large amount of data produced during software evolution.
Objective
This study investigates Software Evolution Visualization (SEV) approaches, collecting evidence about how SEV research is structured, synthesizing current evidence on the goals of the proposed approaches and identifying key challenges for its use in practice.
Methods
A mapping study was conducted to analyze how the SEV area is structured. Selected primary studies were classified and analyzed with respect to nine research questions.
Results
SEV has been used for many different purposes, especially for change comprehension, change prediction and contribution analysis. The analysis identified gaps in the studies with respect to their goals, strategies and approaches. It also pointed out to a widespread lack of empirical studies in the area.
Conclusion
Researchers have proposed many SEV approaches during the past years, but some have failed to clearly state their goals, tie them back to concrete problems, or formally validate their usefulness. The identified gaps indicate that there still are many opportunities to be explored in the area.},

	Abstract = {Context: Traceability in Software Product Lines (SPL) is the ability to interrelate software engineering artifacts through required links to answer specific questions related to the families of products and underlying development processes. Despite the existence of studies to map out available evidence on traceability for single systems development, there is a lack of understanding on common strategies, activities, artifacts, and research gaps for SPL traceability. Objective: This paper analyzes 62 studies dating from 2001 to 2015 and discusses seven aspects of SPL traceability: main goals, strategies, application domains, research intensity, research challenges, rigor, and industrial relevance. In addition to the analysis, this paper also synthesizes the available evidence, identifies open issues and points out areas calling for further research. Method: To gather evidence, we defined a mapping study process adapted from existing guidelines. Driven by a set of research questions, this process comprises three major phases: planning, conducting, and documenting the review. Results: This work provides a structured understanding of SPL traceability, indicating areas for further research. The lack of evidence regarding the application of research methods indicates the need for more rigorous SPL traceability studies with better description of context, study design, and limitations. For practitioners, although most identified studies have low industrial relevance, a few of them have high relevance and thus could provide some decision making support for application of SPL traceability in practice. Conclusions: This work concludes that SPL traceability is maturing and pinpoints areas where further investigation should be performed. As future work, we intend to improve the comparison between traceability proposals for SPL and single-system development.},

	Abstract = {Background
Software quality is complex with over investment, under investment and the interplay between aspects often being overlooked as many researchers aim to advance individual aspects of software quality.
Aim
This paper aims to provide a consolidated overview the literature that addresses trade-offs between aspects of software product quality.
Method
A systematic literature map is employed to provide an overview of software quality trade-off literature in general. Specific analysis is also done of empirical literature addressing the topic.
Results
The results show a wide range of solution proposals being considered. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence to adequately evaluate and compare these proposals. Further a very large vocabulary has been found to describe software quality.
Conclusion
Greater empirical research is required to sufficiently evaluate and compare the wide range of solution proposals. This will allow researchers to focus on the proposals showing greater signs of success and better support industrial practitioners.},

This paper presents a systematic review and mapping that investigated, analyzed, categorized and classified the SBSE approaches that have been proposed to address software requirement selection and prioritization problems, reporting quantitative and qualitative assessment. Initially 39 papers returned from our search strategy in this area and they were analyzed by 18 previously established quality criteria. The results of this systematic review show which aspects of the requirements selection and prioritization problems were addressed by researchers, which approaches and search techniques are currently adopted to address these problems, as well as the strengths and weaknesses in this research area highlighted from the quality criteria.},

@article{Garous_Yusifoglu:2015,
	Abstract = {Context
As a result of automated software testing, large amounts of software test code (script) are usually developed by software teams. Automated test scripts provide many benefits, such as repeatable, predictable, and efficient test executions. However, just like any software development activity, development of test scripts is tedious and error prone. We refer, in this study, to all activities that should be conducted during the entire lifecycle of test-code as Software Test-Code Engineering (STCE).
Objective
As the STCE research area has matured and the number of related studies has increased, it is important to systematically categorize the current state-of-the-art and to provide an overview of the trends in this field. Such summarized and categorized results provide many benefits to the broader community. For example, they are valuable resources for new researchers (e.g., PhD students) aiming to conduct additional secondary studies.
Method
In this work, we systematically classify the body of knowledge related to STCE through a systematic mapping (SM) study. As part of this study, we pose a set of research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria, and systematically develop and refine a systematic map.
Results
Our study pool includes a set of 60 studies published in the area of STCE between 1999 and 2012. Our mapping data is available through an online publicly-accessible repository. We derive the trends for various aspects of STCE. Among our results are the following: (1) There is an acceptable mix of papers with respect to different contribution facets in the field of STCE and the top two leading facets are tool (68%) and method (65%). The studies that presented new processes, however, had a low rate (3%), which denotes the need for more process-related studies in this area. (2) Results of investigation about research facet of studies and comparing our result to other SM studies shows that, similar to other fields in software engineering, STCE is moving towards more rigorous validation approaches. (3) A good mixture of STCE activities has been presented in the primary studies. Among them, the two leading activities are quality assessment and co-maintenance of test-code with production code. The highest growth rate for co-maintenance activities in recent years shows the importance and challenges involved in this activity. (4) There are two main categories of quality assessment activity: detection of test smells and oracle assertion adequacy. (5) JUnit is the leading test framework which has been used in about 50% of the studies. (6) There is a good mixture of SUT types used in the studies: academic experimental systems (or simple code examples), real open-source and commercial systems. (7) Among 41 tools that are proposed for STCE, less than half of the tools (45%) were available for download. It is good to have this percentile of tools to be available, although not perfect, since the availability of tools can lead to higher impact on research community and industry.
Conclusion
We discuss the emerging trends in STCE, and discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners in this area. The results of our systematic mapping can help researchers to obtain an overview of existing STCE approaches and spot areas in the field that require more attention from the research community.},

	Abstract = {Granular computing has attracted many researchers as a new and rapidly growing paradigm of information processing. In this paper, we apply systematic mapping study to classify the granular computing researches to discover relative derivations to specify its research strength and quality. Our search scope is limited to the Science Direct and IEEE Transactions papers published between January 2012 and August 2014. We defined four perspectives of classification schemes to map the selected studies that are focus area, contribution type, research type and framework. Results of mapping the selected studies show that almost half of the research focused area belongs to category of data analysis. In addition, most of the selected papers belong to proposing the solutions in research type scheme. Distribution of papers between tool, method and enhancement categories of contribution type are almost equal. Moreover, 39% of the relevant papers belong to the rough set framework. The results show that there is little attention paid to cluster analysis in existing frameworks to discover granules for classification. We applied five clustering algorithms on three datasets from UCI repository to compare the form of information granules, and then classify the patterns and define them to a specific class based on their geometry and belongings. The clustering algorithms are DBSCAN, c-means, k-means, GAk-means and Fuzzy-GrC and the comparison of information granules are based on the coverage, misclassification and accuracy. The survey of experimental results mostly shows Fuzzy-GrC and GAk-means algorithm superior to other clustering algorithms; while, c-means clustering algorithm shows inferior to other clustering algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Context: Software Engineering (SE) is an evolving discipline with new subareas being continuously developed and added. To structure and better understand the SE body of knowledge, taxonomies have been proposed in all SE knowledge areas. Objective: The objective of this paper is to characterize the state-of-the-art research on SE taxonomies. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted, based on 270 primary studies. Results: An increasing number of SE taxonomies have been published since 2000 in a broad range of venues, including the top SE journals and conferences. The majority of taxonomies can be grouped into the following SWEBOK knowledge areas: construction (19.55%), design (19.55%), requirements (15.50%) and maintenance (11.81%). Illustration (45.76%) is the most frequently used approach for taxonomy validation. Hierarchy (53.14%) and faceted analysis (39.48%) are the most frequently used classification structures. Most taxonomies rely on qualitative procedures to classify subject matter instances, but in most cases (86.53%) these procedures are not described in sufficient detail. The majority of the taxonomies (97%) target unique subject matters and many taxonomy-papers are cited frequently. Most SE taxonomies are designed in an ad-hoc way. To address this issue, we have revised an existing method for developing taxonomies in a more systematic way. Conclusion: There is a strong interest in taxonomies in SE, but few taxonomies are extended or revised. Taxonomy design decisions regarding the used classification structures, procedures and descriptive bases are usually not well described and motivated.},

	Abstract = {Context
Maturity models offer organizations a simple but effective possibility to measure the quality of their processes. Emerged out of software engineering, the application fields have widened and maturity model research is becoming more important. During the last two decades the publication amount steadily rose as well. Until today, no studies have been available summarizing the activities and results of the field of maturity model research.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to structure and analyze the available literature of the field of maturity model research to identify the state-of-the-art research as well as research gaps.
Method
A systematic mapping study was conducted. It included relevant publications of journals and IS conferences. Mapping studies are a suitable method for structuring a broad research field concerning research questions about contents, methods, and trends in the available publications.
Results
The mapping of 237 articles showed that current maturity model research is applicable to more than 20 domains, heavily dominated by software development and software engineering. The study revealed that most publications deal with the development of maturity models and empirical studies. Theoretical reflective publications are scarce. Furthermore, the relation between conceptual and design-oriented maturity model development was analyzed, indicating that there is still a gap in evaluating and validating developed maturity models. Finally, a comprehensive research framework was derived from the study results and implications for further research are given.
Conclusion
The mapping study delivers the first systematic summary of maturity model research. The categorization of available publications helps researchers gain an overview of the state-of-the-art research and current research gaps. The proposed research framework supports researchers categorizing their own projects. In addition, practitioners planning to use a maturity model may use the study as starting point to identify which maturity models are suitable for their domain and where limitations exist.},

	Abstract = {The International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) maintains a repository of data about completed software projects. A common use of the ISBSG dataset is to investigate models to estimate a software project's size, effort, duration, and cost. The aim of this paper is to determine which and to what extent variables in the ISBSG dataset have been used in software engineering to build effort estimation models. For that purpose a systematic mapping study was applied to 107 research papers, obtained after a filtering process, that were published from 2000 until the end of 2013, and which listed the independent variables used in the effort estimation models. The usage of ISBSG variables for filtering, as dependent variables, and as independent variables is described. The 20 variables (out of 71) mostly used as independent variables for effort estimation are identified and analysed in detail, with reference to the papers and types of estimation methods that used them.

	Abstract = {Context
This systematic mapping review is set in a Global Software Engineering (GSE) context, characterized by a highly distributed environment in which project team members work separately in different countries. This geographic separation creates specific challenges associated with global communication, coordination and control.
Objective
The main goal of this study is to discover all the available communication and coordination tools that can support highly distributed teams, how these tools have been applied in GSE, and then to describe and classify the tools to allow both practitioners and researchers involved in GSE to make use of the available tool support in GSE.
Method
We performed a systematic mapping review through a search for studies that answered our research question, ``Which software tools (commercial, free or research based) are available to support Global Software Engineering?'' Applying a range of related search terms to key electronic databases, selected journals, and conferences and workshops enabled us to extract relevant papers. We then used a data extraction template to classify, extract and record important information about the GSD tools from each paper. This information was synthesized and presented as a general map of types of GSD tools, the tool's main features and how each tool was validated in practice.
Results
The main result is a list of 132 tools, which, according to the literature, have been, or are intended to be, used in global software projects. The classification of these tools includes lists of features for communication, coordination and control as well as how the tool has been validated in practice. We found that out the total of 132, the majority of tools were developed at research centers, and only a small percentage of tools (18.9%) are reported as having been tested outside the initial context in which they were developed.
Conclusion
The most common features in the GSE tools included in this study are: team activity and social awareness, support for informal communication, Support for Distributed Knowledge Management and Interoperability with other tools. Finally, there is the need for an evaluation of these tools to verify their external validity, or usefulness in a wider global environment.},

@article{Fernandez:2011,
	Abstract = {Context
In recent years, many usability evaluation methods (UEMs) have been employed to evaluate Web applications. However, many of these applications still do not meet most customers' usability expectations and many companies have folded as a result of not considering Web usability issues. No studies currently exist with regard to either the use of usability evaluation methods for the Web or the benefits they bring.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge that is available as regards the usability evaluation methods (UEMs) that have been employed to evaluate Web applications over the last 14years.
Method
A systematic mapping study was performed to assess the UEMs that have been used by researchers to evaluate Web applications and their relation to the Web development process. Systematic mapping studies are useful for categorizing and summarizing the existing information concerning a research question in an unbiased manner.
Results
The results show that around 39% of the papers reviewed reported the use of evaluation methods that had been specifically crafted for the Web. The results also show that the type of method most widely used was that of User Testing. The results identify several research gaps, such as the fact that around 90% of the studies applied evaluations during the implementation phase of the Web application development, which is the most costly phase in which to perform changes. A list of the UEMs that were found is also provided in order to guide novice usability practitioners.
Conclusions
From an initial set of 2703 papers, a total of 206 research papers were selected for the mapping study. The results obtained allowed us to reach conclusions concerning the state-of-the-art of UEMs for evaluating Web applications. This allowed us to identify several research gaps, which subsequently provided us with a framework in which new research activities can be more appropriately positioned, and from which useful information for novice usability practitioners can be extracted.},

	Abstract = {One aspect often neglected during the development of autonomous mobile robots is the systematic validation of their overall behavior. Especially large robots applied to real-world scenarios may cause injuries or even human death and must therefore be classified as safety-critical. In this paper, a generic approach to defining and executing purposeful test runs using domain-specific languages (dsls) is presented. Test cases can be defined in an appropriate test description language (first dsl). These test cases can be derived automatically using a model-based testing approach, for which a test model has to be created. Hence, a second dsl for the creation of the test model is presented. It is further shown how the generated test cases are automatically executed and evaluated. The paper concludes with the application of the approach to the autonomous off-road robot ravon.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to automatic scenario generation from environment behavior models for testing of real-time reactive systems. The model of behavior is defined as a set of events (event trace) with two basic relations: precedence and inclusion. The attributed event grammar (AEG) specifies possible event traces and provides a uniform approach for automatically generating and executing test cases. The environment model includes a description of hazardous states in which the system may arrive and makes it possible to gather statistics for system safety assessment. The approach is supported by a generator that creates test cases from the AEG models. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of a software prototype of the computer-assisted resuscitation algorithm for a safety-critical casualty intravenous fluid infusion pump.},

	Abstract = {Many safety-concerned standards and regulations for real-time embedded systems, e.g., ISO 26262 for automotive electric/electronic systems, recommends the use of formal techniques to achieve the required safety level. This paper presents a method for formal analysis of real-time embedded systems. The method allows properties to be statistically checked early and quickly with high confidence, and may also produce a formal proof when required. This environment exploits uppaal tools consisting of a symbolic model checker (uppaal MC) and a statistical model checker (uppaal smc), and a model-based testing environment (uppaal Yggdrasil), all of which are based on a formal model in timed automata. We demonstrate our method on an industrial case, an automotive Turn Indicator System, showing how the design of the system at the early phase of system development may be efficiently checked against the defined system requirements.},

	Abstract = {Testing of reactive systems is challenging because long input sequences are often needed to drive them into a state to test a desired feature. This is particularly problematic in on-target testing, where a system is tested in its real-life application environment and the amount of time required for resetting is high. This article presents an approach to discovering a test case chain---a single software execution that covers a group of test goals and minimizes overall test execution time. Our technique targets the scenario in which test goals for the requirements are given as safety properties. We give conditions for the existence and minimality of a single test case chain and minimize the number of test case chains if a single test case chain is infeasible. We report experimental results with our ChainCover tool for C code generated from Simulink models and compare it to state-of-the-art test suite generators.},

This mapping, together with the introduction of a trace semantics for OOAS, paves the way for applying tools for and theory of labeled transition systems to UML-models. As a running example, we use a car alarm system in the context of model-based test-case generation and show how the UML mapping is done.},

	Abstract = {Context
The current validation tests for nuclear software are routinely performed by random testing, which leads to uncertain test coverage. Moreover, validation tests should directly verify the system's compliance with the original user's needs. Unlike current model-based testing methods, which are generally based on requirements or design models, the proposed model is derived from the original user's needs in text through domain-specific ontology, and then used to generate validation tests systematically.
Objective
Our first goal is to develop an objective, repeatable, and efficient systematic validation test scheme that is effective for large systems, with analyzable test coverage. Our second goal is to provide a new model-based validation testing method that reflects the user's original safety needs.
Method
A model-based scenario test case generation for nuclear digital safety systems was designed. This was achieved by converting the scenarios described in natural language in a Safety Analysis Report (SAR) prepared by the power company for licensing review, to Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagrams based on a proposed ontology of a related regulatory standard. Next, we extracted the initial environmental parameters and the described operational sequences. We then performed variations on these data to systematically generate a sufficient number of scenario test cases.
Results
Test coverage criteria, which are the equivalence partition coverage of initial environment, the condition coverage, the action coverage and the scenario coverage, were met using our method.
Conclusion
The proposed model-based scenario testing can provide improved testing coverage than random testing. A test suite based on user needs can be provided.},

@inproceedings{Gentile:2014,
	Abstract = {Model Based Testing (MBT) enables automatic generation of test cases using models to specify the system behavior and requirements. Key features of MBT approaches are the automation level and the complexity of non-automated steps. Usually, test case generation is supported by some automatic technique whereas modeling is manually performed. UML statecharts or other extended finite state machine formalisms are widely used to build behavior models. To ease their development, as well as the extraction of test cases from them, is an important aspect to be addressed in order to perform testing activities with lower skill, cost and effort. This paper aims at providing a contribution to both the issues. Test Specification Patterns (TSPs) are proposed and expressed by means of UML annotated statecharts as a mean to aid the construction of models and build specifications on the base of well known recurring problems and their solutions (patterns). In order to improve usability and increase the automation level, a transformational approach is defined which derives Promela code from specifications built by TSPs composition and applies model checking to obtain test sequences by using the SPIN model checker. The usage of TSPs and the test case generation process is illustrated on a test scenario from the Radio Block Centre, the vital core of the modern railway control systems.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a new approach for model-based test case generation (MBTCG) for large systems, which not only supports the expression of complex requirements (constraints) using OCL, but also lays ground for improving the efficiency (i.e. maximum coverage with minimal number of test cases) of the generated test case set. For that purpose, UML/OCL models are transformed to (object-oriented) action systems, where test cases are generated by means of mutation. The resulting ``abstract'' test cases represent input/output sequences with possible branches according to valid alternatives in system responses. They have finally to be transformed to ``concrete'' test cases which can be applied to the target application. The described work is part of the European project MOGENTES.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Due to the dynamic and ephemeral nature of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) environments, it is especially important that the application software in ubicomp environments is trustworthy. In order to have trustworthy application software in ubicomp environments, situation-awareness (SAW) in the application software is needed to enforce flexible security policies and detect violations of security policies. In this paper, an approach is presented to provide development and runtime support to incorporate SAW in trustworthy ubicomp application software. The development support is to provide SAW requirement specification and automated code generation to achieve SAW in trustworthy ubicomp application software, and the runtime support is for context acquisition, situation analysis and situation-aware communication. To realize our approach, the improved Reconfigurable Context-Sensitive Middleware (RCSM) is developed to provide the above development and runtime support.

	Abstract = {Information System (IS) development has been beset by consistency problems since its infancy. These problems are greater still in UML software development, and are principally caused by the existence of multiple views (models) for the same system, and may involve potentially contradictory system specifications. Since a considerable amount of work takes place within the scope of model consistency management, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) which was carried out to discover the various current model consistency conceptions, proposals, problems and solutions provided. To do this, a total of 907 papers related to UML model consistency published in literature and extracted from the most relevant scientific sources (IEEE Computer Society, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and the SCOPUS Database) were considered, of which 42 papers were eventually analyzed. This systematic literature review resulted in the identification of the current state-of-the-art with regard to UML model consistency management research along with open issues, trends and future research within this scope. A formal approach for the handling of inconsistency problems which fulfils the identified limitations is also briefly presented.},

	Abstract = {More attention is paid to the quality of models along with the growing importance of modelling in software development. We performed a systematic review of studies discussing model quality published since 2000 to identify what model quality means and how it can be improved. From forty studies covered in the review, six model quality goals were identified; i.e., correctness, completeness, consistency, comprehensibility, confinement and changeability. We further present six practices proposed for developing high-quality models together with examples of empirical evidence. The contributions of the article are identifying and classifying definitions of model quality and identifying gaps for future research.},

	Abstract = {Model-Driven Development (MDD) emphasizes the use of models at a higher abstraction level in the software development process and argues in favor of automation via model execution, transformation, and code generation. However, one current challenge is how to manage requirements during this process whilst simultaneously stressing the benefits of automation. This paper presents a systematic review of the current use of requirements engineering techniques in MDD processes and their actual automation level. 72 papers from the last decade have been reviewed from an initial set of 884 papers. The results show that although MDD techniques are used to a great extent in platform-independent models, platform-specific models, and at code level, at the requirements level most MDD approaches use only partially defined requirements models or even natural language. We additionally identify several research gaps such as a need for more efforts to explicitly deal with requirements traceability and the provision of better tool support.},

One challenge is to unite the vision from business and software areas, to design and implement business processes in a way that allows organizations to react agilely to changes. New paradigms have appeared to support this vision: Business Process Management (BPM), Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) and Model-Driven Development (MDD). BPM deals with managing business process lifecycle from modeling, implementation, execution and evaluation to find improvement opportunities. SOC bases the design and implementation of software on services, which are defined to support business processes. MDD focus is on models, allowing the definition of automatic transformation between them along with code generation for different platforms. In this article we present the main principles for the integration of these paradigms as found in a systematic review carried out with the objective of establishing the bases for our research.},

@article{Dominguez:2012,
	Abstract = {Context
Model Driven Development (MDD) encourages the use of models for developing complex software systems. Following a MDD approach, modelling languages are used to diagrammatically model the structure and behaviour of object-oriented software, among which state-based languages (including UML state machines, finite state machines and Harel statecharts) constitute the most widely used to specify the dynamic behaviour of a system. However, generating code from state machine models as part of the final system constitutes one of the most challenging tasks due to its dynamic nature and because many state machine concepts are not supported by the object-oriented programming languages. Therefore, it is not surprising that such code generation has received great attention over the years.
Objective
The overall objective of this paper is to plot the landscape of published proposals in the field of object oriented code generation from state machine specifications, restricting the search neither to a specific context nor to a particular programming language.
Method
We perform a systematic, accurate literature review of published studies focusing on the object oriented implementation of state machine specifications.
Results
The systematic review is based on a comprehensive set of 53 resources in all, which we have classified into two groups: pattern-based and not pattern-based. For each proposal, we have analysed both the state machine specification elements they support and the means the authors propose for their implementation. Additionally, the review investigates which proposals take into account desirable features to be considered in software development such as maintenance or reusability.
Conclusions
One of the conclusions drawn from the review is that most of the analysed works are based on a software design pattern. Another key finding is that many papers neither support several of the main components of the expressive richness of state machine specifications nor provide an implementation strategy that considers relevant qualitative aspects in software development.},

@article{Gonzalez:2014,
	Abstract = {Context
Model-driven Engineering (MDE) promotes the utilization of models as primary artifacts in all software engineering activities. Therefore, mechanisms to ensure model correctness become crucial, specially when applying MDE to the development of software, where software is the result of a chain of (semi)automatic model transformations that refine initial abstract models to lower level ones from which the final code is eventually generated. Clearly, in this context, an error in the model/s is propagated to the code endangering the soundness of the resulting software. Formal verification of software models is a promising approach that advocates the employment of formal methods to achieve model correctness, and it has received a considerable amount of attention in the last few years.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to analyze the state of the art in the field of formal verification of models, restricting the analysis to those approaches applied over static software models complemented or not with constraints expressed in textual languages, typically the Object Constraint Language (OCL).
Method
We have conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the published works in this field, describing their main characteristics.
Results
The study is based on a set of 48 resources that have been grouped in 18 different approaches according to their affinity. For each of them we have analyzed, among other issues, the formalism used, the support given to OCL, the correctness properties addressed or the feedback yielded by the verification process.
Conclusions
One of the most important conclusions obtained is that current model verification approaches are strongly influenced by the support given to OCL. Another important finding is that in general, current verification tools present important flaws like the lack of integration into the model designer tool chain or the lack of efficiency when verifying large, real-life models.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Software product line (SPL) engineering is a software engineering approach to building configurable software systems. SPLs commonly use a feature model to capture and document the commonalities and variabilities of the underlying software system. A key challenge when using a feature model to derive a new SPL configuration is determining how to find an optimized feature selection that minimizes or maximizes an objective function, such as total cost, subject to resource constraints. To help address the challenges of optimizing feature selection in the face of resource constraints, this paper presents an approach that uses G enetic A lgorithms for optimized FE ature S election (GAFES) in SPLs. Our empirical results show that GAFES can produce solutions with 86--97% of the optimality of other automated feature selection algorithms and in 45--99% less time than existing exact and heuristic feature selection techniques.},

@article{Costa:2015,
	Abstract = {Context
Most specialized users (scientists) that use bioinformatics applications do not have suitable training on software development. Software Product Line (SPL) employs the concept of reuse considering that it is defined as a set of systems that are developed from a common set of base artifacts. In some contexts, such as in bioinformatics applications, it is advantageous to develop a collection of related software products, using SPL approach. If software products are similar enough, there is the possibility of predicting their commonalities, differences and then reuse these common features to support the development of new applications in the bioinformatics area.
Objectives
This paper presents the PL-Science approach which considers the context of SPL and ontology in order to assist scientists to define a scientific experiment, and to specify a workflow that encompasses bioinformatics applications of a given experiment. This paper also focuses on the use of ontologies to enable the use of Software Product Line in biological domains.
Method
In the context of this paper, Scientific Software Product Line (SSPL) differs from the Software Product Line due to the fact that SSPL uses an abstract scientific workflow model. This workflow is defined according to a scientific domain and using this abstract workflow model the products (scientific applications/algorithms) are instantiated.
Results
Through the use of ontology as a knowledge representation model, we can provide domain restrictions as well as add semantic aspects in order to facilitate the selection and organization of bioinformatics workflows in a Scientific Software Product Line. The use of ontologies enables not only the expression of formal restrictions but also the inferences on these restrictions, considering that a scientific domain needs a formal specification.
Conclusions
This paper presents the development of the PL-Science approach, encompassing a methodology and an infrastructure, and also presents an approach evaluation. This evaluation presents case studies in bioinformatics, which were conducted in two renowned research institutions in Brazil.},

	Abstract = {Successful software evolves from a single system by adding and changing functionality to keep up with users' demands and to cater to their similar and different requirements. Nowadays it is a common practice to offer a system in many variants such as community, professional, or academic editions. Each variant provides different functionality described in terms of features. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is an effective software development paradigm for this scenario. At the core of SPLE is variability modelling whose goal is to represent the combinations of features that distinguish the system variants using feature models, the de facto standard for such task. As SPLE practices are becoming more pervasive, reverse engineering feature models from the feature descriptions of each individual variant has become an active research subject. In this paper we evaluated, for this reverse engineering task, three standard search based techniques (evolutionary algorithms, hill climbing, and random search) with two objective functions on 74 SPLs. We compared their performance using precision and recall, and found a clear trade-off between these two metrics which we further reified into a third objective function based on Fβ, an information retrieval measure, that showed a clear performance improvement. We believe that this work sheds light on the great potential of search-based techniques for SPLE tasks.},

	Abstract = {Over the last two decades, software product lines have been used successfully in industry for building families of systems of related products, maximizing reuse, and exploiting their variable and configurable options. In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures.},

	Abstract = {Mobile applications require dynamic reconfiguration services (DRS) to self-adapt their behavior to the context changes (e.g., scarcity of resources). Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) are a well-accepted approach to manage runtime variability, by means of late binding the variation points at runtime. During the system's execution, the DRS deploys different configurations to satisfy the changing requirements according to a multiobjective criterion (e.g., insufficient battery level, requested quality of service). Search-based software engineering and, in particular, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), can generate valid configurations of a DSPL at runtime. Several approaches use MOEAs to generate optimum configurations of a Software Product Line, but none of them consider DSPLs for mobile devices. In this paper, we explore the use of MOEAs to generate at runtime optimum configurations of the DSPL according to different criteria. The optimization problem is formalized in terms of a Feature Model (FM), a variability model. We evaluate six existing MOEAs by applying them to 12 different FMs, optimizing three different objectives (usability, battery consumption and memory footprint). The results are discussed according to the particular requirements of a DRS for mobile applications, showing that PAES and NSGA-II are the most suitable algorithms for mobile environments.},

	Abstract = {A feature model is an essential tool to identify variability and commonality within a product line of an enterprise, assisting stakeholders to configure product lines and to discover opportunities for reuse. However, the number of product variants needed to satisfy individual customer needs is still an open question, as feature models do not incorporate any direct customer preference information. In this paper, we propose to incorporate customer preference information into feature models using sentiment analysis of user-generated online product reviews. The proposed sentiment analysis method is a hybrid combination of affective lexicons and a rough-set technique. It is able to predict sentence sentiments for individual product features with acceptable accuracy, and thus augment a feature model by integrating positive and negative opinions of the customers. Such opinionated customer preference information is regarded as one attribute of the features, which helps to decide the number of variants needed within a product line. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed method via an application case of Kindle Fire HD tablets.},

	Abstract = {Mass customization is the new frontier in business competition for both manufacturing and service industries. To improve customer satisfaction, reduce lead-times and shorten costs, families of similar products are built jointly by combining reusable parts that implement the features demanded by the customers. To guarantee the validity of the products derived from mass customization processes, feature dependencies and incompatibilities are usually specified with a variability model. As market demand grows and evolves, variability models become increasingly complex. In such entangled models it is hard to identify which features are essential, dispensable, highly required by other features, or highly incompatible with the remaining features. This paper exposes the limitations of existing approaches to gather such knowledge and provides efficient algorithms to retrieve that information from variability models.},

A recent literature review reported that more than 30 analysis operations have been identified and different analysis mechanisms have been proposed. Product configuration is a well established research field with more than 30 years of successful applications in different industrial domains. Our hypothesis, that is not really new, is that these two independent areas of research have interesting synergies that have not been fully explored. To try to explore the potential synergies systematically, in this paper we provide a rapid review to bring together these previously disparate streams of work. We define a set of research questions and give a preliminary answer to some of them. We conclude that there are many research opportunities in the synergy of these independent areas.},

	Abstract = {Software product-lines (SPLs) are software platforms that can be readily reconfigured for different project requirements. A key part of an SPL is a model that captures the rules for reconfiguring the software. SPLs commonly use feature models to capture SPL configuration rules. Each SPL configuration is represented as a selection of features from the feature model. Invalid SPL configurations can be created due to feature conflicts introduced via staged or parallel configuration or changes to the constraints in a feature model. When invalid configurations are created, a method is needed to automate the diagnosis of the errors and repair the feature selections. This paper provides two contributions to research on automated configuration of SPLs. First, it shows how configurations and feature models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems to automatically diagnose errors and repair invalid feature selections. Second, it presents empirical results from diagnosing configuration errors in feature models ranging in size from 100 to 5,000 features. The results of our experiments show that our CSP-based diagnostic technique can scale up to models with thousands of features.},

	Abstract = {A feature model is a compact representation of the products of a software product line. The automated extraction of information from feature models is a thriving topic involving numerous analysis operations, techniques and tools. Performance evaluations in this domain mainly rely on the use of random feature models. However, these only provide a rough idea of the behaviour of the tools with average problems and are not sufficient to reveal their real strengths and weaknesses. In this article, we propose to model the problem of finding computationally hard feature models as an optimization problem and we solve it using a novel evolutionary algorithm for optimized feature models (ETHOM). Given a tool and an analysis operation, ETHOM generates input models of a predefined size maximizing aspects such as the execution time or the memory consumption of the tool when performing the operation over the model. This allows users and developers to know the performance of tools in pessimistic cases providing a better idea of their real power and revealing performance bugs. Experiments using ETHOM on a number of analyses and tools have successfully identified models producing much longer executions times and higher memory consumption than those obtained with random models of identical or even larger size.},

	Abstract = {Context
A feature model (FM) represents the valid combinations of features in a domain. The automated extraction of information from FMs is a complex task that involves numerous analysis operations, techniques and tools. Current testing methods in this context are manual and rely on the ability of the tester to decide whether the output of an analysis is correct. However, this is acknowledged to be time-consuming, error-prone and in most cases infeasible due to the combinatorial complexity of the analyses, this is known as the oracle problem.
Objective
In this paper, we propose using metamorphic testing to automate the generation of test data for feature model analysis tools overcoming the oracle problem. An automated test data generator is presented and evaluated to show the feasibility of our approach.
Method
We present a set of relations (so-called metamorphic relations) between input FMs and the set of products they represent. Based on these relations and given a FM and its known set of products, a set of neighbouring FMs together with their corresponding set of products are automatically generated and used for testing multiple analyses. Complex FMs representing millions of products can be efficiently created by applying this process iteratively.
Results
Our evaluation results using mutation testing and real faults reveal that most faults can be automatically detected within a few seconds. Two defects were found in FaMa and another two in SPLOT, two real tools for the automated analysis of feature models. Also, we show how our generator outperforms a related manual suite for the automated analysis of feature models and how this suite can be used to guide the automated generation of test cases obtaining important gains in efficiency.
Conclusion
Our results show that the application of metamorphic testing in the domain of automated analysis of feature models is efficient and effective in detecting most faults in a few seconds without the need for a human oracle.},

	Abstract = {Software product line engineering is a method of producing a set of related products that share more commonalities than variability in a cost-effective approach. Software product lines provide systematic reuse within a product family. Extended feature models with cardinalities are widely used for managing variability and commonality in the software product line domains. In this paper, we use promotion technique in Alloy to formalize constraint based extended feature models with cardinalities and their specialization and generalization. This technique has a significant influence on applying analysis operations on feature models. To show the benefits of the promotion technique, we calculate the reuse ratio of a feature in a large scale software product line. In the presented method, in addition to feature and group cardinalities, we consider different combinations of cardinalities with each other as well as feature cloning.},

@article{Tanhaei:2016,
	Abstract = {Context: Feature model is an appropriate and indispensable tool for modeling similarities and differences among products of the Software Product Line (SPL). It not only exposes the validity of the products' configurations in an SPL but also changes in the course of time to support new requirements of the SPL. Modifications made on the feature model in the course of time raise a number of issues. Useless enlargements of the feature model, the existence of dead features, and violated constraints in the feature model are some of the key problems that make its maintenance difficult. Objective: The initial approach to dealing with the above-mentioned problems and improving maintainability of the feature model is refactoring. Refactoring modifies software artifacts in a way that their externally visible behavior does not change. Method: We introduce a method for defining refactoring rules and executing them on the feature model. We use the ATL model transformation language to define the refactoring rules. Moreover, we provide an Alloy model to check the feature model and the safety of the refactorings that are performed on it. Results: In this research, we propose a safe framework for refactoring a feature model. This framework enables users to perform automatic and semi-automatic refactoring on the feature model. Conclusions: Automated tool support for refactoring is a key issue for adopting approaches such as utilizing feature models and integrating them into the software development process of companies. In this work, we define some of the important refactoring rules on the feature model and provide tools that enable users to add new rules using the ATL M2M language. Our framework assesses the correctness of the refactorings using the Alloy language.},

	Abstract = {Changeability is a fundamental property of software systems. Every software system must evolve at all levels of abstraction (models, architecture, source code, documentation, etc.) to meet changing user and context requirements. To assess the extent of a change, change impact analysis must be performed. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of change aspects in feature modelling domain, and analyse changeability of feature models, a high level representation of system's external user-visible characteristics. We propose the change impact model based on a feature dependency matrix to assess validity of feature change, to follow feature change propagation and to estimate changeability of a feature model using a Jaccard distance measure. The model is implemented using Prolog logic rules. A case study is presented.},

	Abstract = {Feature modeling is a technique for capturing commonality and variability. Feature models symbolize a representation of the possible application configuration space, and can be customized based on specific domain requirements and stakeholder goals. Most feature model configuration processes neglect the need to have a holistic approach towards the integration and satisfaction of the stakeholder's soft and hard constraints, and the application-domain integrity constraints. In this paper, we will show how the structure and constraints of a feature model can be modeled uniformly through Propositional Logic extended with concrete domains, called {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}P{\}}{\{}(N){\}}{\$}. Furthermore, we formalize the representation of soft constraints in fuzzy {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}P{\}}{\{}(N){\}}{\$}and explain how semi-automated feature model configuration is performed. The model configuration derivation process that we propose respects the soundness and completeness properties.},

	Abstract = {Process-based context-aware applications are increasingly becoming more complex and dynamic. Besides the large sets of process variants to be managed in such dynamic systems, process variants need to be context sensitive in order to accommodate new user requirements and intrinsic complexity. This paradigm shift forces us to defer decisions to runtime where process variants must be customized and executed based on a recognized context. However, there exists a lack of deferral of the entire process variant configuration and execution to perform an automated decision of subsequent variation points at runtime. In this paper, we present a holistic methodology to automatically resolve process variability at runtime. The proposed solution performs a staged configuration considering static and dynamic context data to accomplish effective decision making. We demonstrate our approach by exemplifying a storage operation process in a smart logistics scenario. Our evaluation demonstrates the performance and scalability results of our methodology.},

	Abstract = {Cost-effective testing of a product in a product line requires obtaining a set of relevant test cases from the entire test suite via test selection and minimization techniques. In this paper, we particularly focus on test minimization for product lines, which identifies and eliminates redundant test cases from test suites in order to reduce the total number of test cases to execute, thereby improving the efficiency of testing. However, such minimization may result in the minimized test suite with low test coverage, low fault revealing capability, low priority test cases, and require more time than the allowed testing budget (e.g., time) as compared to the original test suite. To deal with the above issues, we formulated the minimization problem as a search problem and defined a fitness function considering various optimization objectives based on the above issues. To assess the performance of our fitness function, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation by investigating the fitness function with three weight-based Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and seven multi-objective search algorithms using an industrial case study and 500 artificial problems inspired from the industrial case study. The results show that Random-Weighted Genetic Algorithm (RWGA) significantly outperforms the other algorithms since RWGA can balance all the objectives together by dynamically updating weights during each generation. Based on the results of our empirical evaluation, we also implemented a tool called TEst Minimization using Search Algorithms (TEMSA) to support test minimization using various search algorithms in the context of product lines.},

	Abstract = {Deriving products from a Feature Model (FM) for testing Software Product Lines (SPLs) is a hard task. It is important to select a minimum number of products but, at the same time, to consider the coverage of testing criteria such as pairwise, among other factors. To solve such problems Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied. However, to design a solution for this and other software engineering problems can be very difficult, because it is necessary to choose among different search operators and parameters. Hyper-heuristics can help in this task, and have raised interest in the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. Considering the growing adoption of SPL in the industry and crescent demand for SPL testing approaches, this paper introduces a hyper-heuristic approach to automatically derive products to variability testing of SPLs. The approach works with MOEAs and two selection methods, random and based on FRR-MAB (Fitness Rate Rank based Multi-Armed Bandit). It was evaluated with real FMs and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional algorithms used in the literature, and that both selection methods present similar performance.},

	Abstract = {Configurable reference process models encompass common and variable processes of organizations from different business domains. These reference process models are designed and reused to guide and derive customized business processes according to the requirements of stakeholders. The customization process is generally initiated by a configuration step, selecting a subset of the reference process model. Configuration is followed by a customization step, which assumes adapting or extending the configured business process based on the specific or unforeseen requirements. Hence, it is crucial to validate the correctness and compliance of the final customized business process with respect to the patterns and business constraints that are specified in the reference model. In this paper, we firstly introduce a technique to develop a customized process model and then present a set of identified inconsistency patterns that may happen during the configuration of a reference model and the customization of configured process models. Furthermore, we describe our proposed approach including formal representations and algorithms that provide logical reasoning and enable automatic inconsistency detection by leveraging description logic. In order to explore the scalability of the approach, we designed the experiments with various process models sizes and inconsistency distributions. The results of the experiments revealed the scalability of our approach with large size process models (500 activities).},

	Abstract = {Context
Feature models are commonly used to capture and communicate the commonality and variability of features in a Software Product Line. The core component of Feature models is feature diagrams, which graphically depict features in a hierarchical form. In previous work we have proposed a new notation that aims to improve the cognitive effectiveness of feature diagrams.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to empirically validate the cognitive effectiveness of the new feature diagrams notation in comparison to its original form.
Methods
We use two distinct empirical user-studies to validate the new notation. The first empirical study uses the survey approach while the second study is a subject-based experiment. The survey study investigates the semantic transparency of the new notation while the second study investigates the speed and accuracy of reading the notation.
Results
The results of the studies indicate that the proposed changes have significantly improved its cognitive effectiveness.
Conclusions
The cognitive effectiveness of feature diagrams has been improved, however there remains further research for full acceptance of the new notation by its potential user community.},

Coping with evolution in automated production systems implies a cross-disciplinary challenge along the system's life-cycle for variant-rich systems of high complexity. The authors from computer science and automation provide an interdisciplinary survey on challenges and state of the art in evolution of automated production systems. Selected challenges are illustrated on the case of a simple pick and place unit. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the development process of automated production systems as well as the different type of evolutions during the system's life-cycle on the case of a pick and place unit. In the second part, we survey the challenges associated with evolution in the different development phases and a couple of cross-cutting areas and review existing approaches addressing the challenges. We close with summarizing future research directions to address the challenges of evolution in automated production systems.},

@article{White:2014,
	Abstract = {The increasing complexity and cost of software-intensive systems has led developers to seek ways of reusing software components across development projects. One approach to increasing software reusability is to develop a software product-line (SPL), which is a software architecture that can be reconfigured and reused across projects. Rather than developing software from scratch for a new project, a new configuration of the SPL is produced. It is hard, however, to find a configuration of an SPL that meets an arbitrary requirement set and does not violate any configuration constraints in the SPL. Existing research has focused on techniques that produce a configuration of an SPL in a single step. Budgetary constraints or other restrictions, however, may require multi-step configuration processes. For example, an aircraft manufacturer may want to produce a series of configurations of a plane over a span of years without exceeding a yearly budget to add features. This paper provides three contributions to the study of multi-step configuration for SPLs. First, we present a formal model of multi-step SPL configuration and map this model to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Second, we show how solutions to these SPL configuration problems can be automatically derived with a constraint solver by mapping them to CSPs. Moreover, we show how feature model changes can be mapped to our approach in a multi-step scenario by using feature model drift. Third, we present empirical results demonstrating that our CSP-based reasoning technique can scale to SPL models with hundreds of features and multiple configuration steps.},

	Abstract = {Evaluating the quality of a feature model is essential to ensure that errors in the early stages do not spread throughout the Software Product Line (SPL). One way to evaluate the feature model is to use measures that could be associated with the feature model quality characteristics and their quality attributes. In this paper, we aim at investigating how measures can be applied to the quality assessment of SPL feature models. We performed an exploratory case study using the COfFEE maintainability measures catalog and the S.P.L.O.T. feature models repository. In order to support this case study, we built a dataset (denoted by MAcchiATO) containing the values of 32 measures from COfFEE for 218 software feature models, extracted from S.P.L.O.T. This research approach allowed us to explore three different data analysis techniques. First, we applied the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in order to identify relationships between the measures. This analysis showed that not all 32 measures in COfFEE are necessary to reveal the quality of a feature model and just 15 measures could be used. Next, the 32 measures in COfFEE were grouped by applying the Principal Component Analysis and a set of 9 new grouped measures were defined. Finally, we used the Tolerance Interval technique to define statistical thresholds for these 9 new grouped measures. So, our findings suggest that measures can be effectively used to support the quality evaluation of SPL feature models.},

	Abstract = {Formal specification and verification techniques have been used successfully to detect feature interactions. We investigate whether feature-based specifications can be used for this task. Feature-based specifications are a special class of specifications that aim at modularity in open-world, feature-oriented systems. The question we address is whether modularity of specifications impairs the ability to detect feature interactions, which cut across feature boundaries. In an exploratory study on 10 feature-oriented systems, we found that the majority of feature interactions could be detected based on feature-based specifications, but some specifications have not been modularized properly and require undesirable workarounds to modularization. Based on the study, we discuss the merits and limitations of feature-based specifications, as well as open issues and perspectives. A goal that underlies our work is to raise awareness of the importance and challenges of feature-based specification.},

	Abstract = {Software configuration, which aims to customize the software for different users (e.g., Linux kernel configuration), is an important and complicated task. In software product line engineering (SPLE), feature oriented domain analysis is adopted and feature model is used to guide the configuration of new product variants. In SPLE, product configuration is an optimal feature selection problem, which needs to find a set of features that have no conflicts and meanwhile achieve multiple design objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing the number of features). In previous studies, several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used for the optimal feature selection problem and indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) was proven to be the best MOEA for this problem. However, IBEA still suffers from the issues of correctness and diversity of found solutions. In this paper, we propose a dual-population evolutionary algorithm, named IBED, to achieve both correctness and diversity of solutions. In IBED, two populations are individually evolved with two different types of evolutionary operators, i.e., IBEA operators and differential evolution (DE) operators. Furthermore, we propose two enhancement techniques for existing MOEAs, namely the feedback-directed mechanism to fast find the correct solutions (e.g., solutions that satisfy the feature model constraints) and the preprocessing method to reduce the search space. Our empirical results have shown that IBED with the enhancement techniques can outperform several state-of-the-art MOEAs on most case studies in terms of correctness and diversity of found solutions.},

	Abstract = {Metamodels evolve over time, which can break the conformance between the models and the metamodel. Model migration strategies aim to co-evolve models and metamodels together, but their application is currently not fully automatizable and is thus cumbersome and error prone. We introduce the Variable MetaModel (VMM) strategy to address the evolution of the reusable model assets of a model-based Software Product Line. The VMM strategy applies variability modeling ideas to express the evolution of the metamodel in terms of commonalities and variabilities. When the metamodel evolves, changes are automatically formalized into the VMM and models that conform to previous versions of the metamodel continue to conform to the VMM, thus eliminating the need for migration. We have applied both the traditional migration strategy and the VMM strategy to a retrospective case study that includes 13years of evolution of our industrial partner, an induction hobs manufacturer. The comparison between the two strategies shows better results for the VMM strategy in terms of model indirection, automation, and trust leak.},

	Abstract = {Context
Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the discipline of controlling the evolution of large and complex software systems. Over the years many different SCM systems sharing similar concepts have been implemented from scratch. Since these concepts usually are hard-wired into the respective program code, reuse is hardly possible.
Objective
Our objective is to create a model-driven product line for SCM systems. By explicitly describing the different concepts using models, reuse can be performed on the modeling level. Since models are executable, the need for manual programming is eliminated. Furthermore, by providing a library of loosely coupled modules, we intend to support flexible composition of SCM systems.
Method
We developed a method and a tool set for model-driven software product line engineering which we applied to the SCM domain. For domain analysis, we applied the FORM method, resulting in a layered feature model for SCM systems. Furthermore, we developed an executable object-oriented domain model which was annotated with features from the feature model. A specific SCM system is configured by selecting features from the feature model and elements of the domain model realizing these features.
Results
Due to the orthogonality of both feature model and domain model, a very large number of SCM systems may be configured. We tested our approach by creating instances of the product line which mimic wide-spread systems such as CVS, GIT, Mercurial, and Subversion.
Conclusion
The experiences gained from this project demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to model-driven software product line engineering. Furthermore, our work advances the state of the art in the domain of SCM systems since it support the modular composition of SCM systems at the model rather than the code level.},

	Abstract = {Cloud computing can reduce power consumption by using virtualized computational resources to provision an application's computational resources on demand. Auto-scaling is an important cloud computing technique that dynamically allocates computational resources to applications to match their current loads precisely, thereby removing resources that would otherwise remain idle and waste power. This paper presents a model-driven engineering approach to optimizing the configuration, energy consumption, and operating cost of cloud auto-scaling infrastructure to create greener computing environments that reduce emissions resulting from superfluous idle resources. The paper provides four contributions to the study of model-driven configuration of cloud auto-scaling infrastructure by (1) explaining how virtual machine configurations can be captured in feature models, (2) describing how these models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) for configuration and energy consumption optimization, (3) showing how optimal auto-scaling configurations can be derived from these CSPs with a constraint solver, and (4) presenting a case study showing the energy consumption/cost reduction produced by this model-driven approach.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a methodology to design robot-oriented generative learning objects (GLOs) that are, in fact, heterogeneous meta-programs to teach computer science (CS) topics such as programming. The methodology includes CS learning variability modelling using the feature-based approaches borrowed from the SW engineering domain. Firstly, we define the CS learning domain using the known educational framework TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy And Content Knowledge). By learning variability we mean the attributes of the framework extracted and represented as feature models with multiple values. Therefore, the CS learning variability represents the problem domain. Meta-programming is considered as a solution domain. Both are represented by feature models. The GLO design task is formulated as mapping the problem domain model on the solution domain model. Next, we present the design framework to design GLOs manually or semi-automatically. The multi-level separation of concepts, model representation and transformation forms the conceptual background. Its theoretical background includes: (a) a formal definition of feature-based models; (b) a graph-based and set-based definition of meta-programming concepts; (c) transformation rules to support the model mapping; (d) a computational Abstract State Machine model to define the processes and design tool for developing GLOs. We present the architecture and some characteristics of the tool. The tool enables to improve the GLO design process significantly (in terms of time and quality) and to achieve a higher quality and functionality of GLOs themselves (in terms of the parameter space enlargement for reuse and adaptation). We demonstrate the appropriateness of the methodology in the real teaching setting. In this paper, we present the case study that analyses three robot-oriented GLOs as the higher-level specifications. Then, using the meta-language processor, we are able to produce, from the specifications, the concrete robot control programs on demand automatically and to demonstrate teaching algorithms visually by robot's actions. We evaluate the approach from technological and pedagogical perspectives using the known structural metrics. Also, we indicate the merits and demerits of the approach. The main contribution and originality of the paper is the seamless integration of two known technologies (feature modelling and meta-programming) in designing robot-oriented GLOs and their supporting tools.},

	Abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPL) are an engineering technique to efficiently derive a set of similar products from a set of shared assets. In particular in conjunction with model-driven engineering, SPL engineering promises high productivity benefits. There is however, a lack of support for systematic management of SPL evolution, which is an important success factor as a product line often represents a long term investment. In this article, we present a model-driven approach for managing SPL evolution on feature level. To reduce complexity we use model fragments to cluster related elements. The relationships between these fragments are specified using feature model concepts itself leading to a specific kind of feature model called EvoFM. A configuration of EvoFM represents an evolution step and can be transformed to a concrete instance of the product line (i.e., a feature model for the corresponding point in time). Similarly, automatic transformations allow the derivation of an EvoFM from a given set of feature models. This enables retrospective analysis of historic evolution and serves as a starting point for introduction of EvoFM, e.g., to plan future evolution steps.},

@article{Parejo:2016,
	Abstract = {Test case prioritization schedules test cases for execution in an order that attempts to accelerate the detection of faults. The order of test cases is determined by prioritization objectives such as covering code or critical components as rapidly as possible. The importance of this technique has been recognized in the context of Highly-Configurable Systems (HCSs), where the potentially huge number of configurations makes testing extremely challenging. However, current approaches for test case prioritization in HCSs suffer from two main limitations. First, the prioritization is usually driven by a single objective which neglects the potential benefits of combining multiple criteria to guide the detection of faults. Second, instead of using industry-strength case studies, evaluations are conducted using synthetic data, which provides no information about the effectiveness of different prioritization objectives. In this paper, we address both limitations by studying 63 combinations of up to three prioritization objectives in accelerating the detection of faults in the Drupal framework. Results show that non--functional properties such as the number of changes in the features are more effective than functional metrics extracted from the configuration model. Results also suggest that multi-objective prioritization typically results in faster fault detection than mono-objective prioritization.},

	Abstract = {A key aspect in any process-oriented organisation is the evaluation of process performance for the achievement of its strategic and operational goals. Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) are a key asset to carry out this evaluation, and, therefore, having an appropriate definition of these PPIs is crucial. After a careful review of the literature related and a study of the current picture in different real organisations, we conclude that there not exists any proposal that allows to define PPIs in a way that is unambiguous and highly expressive, understandable by technical and non-technical users and traceable with the Business Process (BP). In addition, like other activities carried out during the BP lifecycle, the management of PPIs is considered time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, providing an automated support for them is very appealing from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose the PPINOT metamodel, which allows such an advanced definition of PPIs and is independent of the language used to model the business process. Furthermore, we provide an automatic semantic mapping from the metamodel to Description Logics (DL) that allows the implementation of design-time analysis operations in such a way that DL reasoners' facilities can be leveraged. These operations provide information that can assist process analysts in the definition and instrumentation of PPIs. Finally, to validate the usefulness of our proposal, we have used the PPINOT metamodel at the core of a software tool called the PPINOT Tool Suite and we have applied it in several real scenarios.},

@article{Dermeval:2015,
	Abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a set of software systems that have a particular set of common features and that satisfy the needs of a particular market segment or mission. Feature modeling is one of the key activities involved in the design of SPLs. The feature diagram produced in this activity captures the commonalities and variabilities of SPLs. In some complex domains (e.g., ubiquitous computing, autonomic systems and context-aware computing), it is difficult to foresee all functionalities and variabilities a specific SPL may require. Thus, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) bind variation points at runtime to adapt to fluctuations in user needs as well as to adapt to changes in the environment. In this context, relying on formal representations of feature models is important to allow them to be automatically analyzed during system execution. Among the mechanisms used for representing and analyzing feature models, description logic (DL) based approaches demand to be better investigated in DSPLs since it provides capabilities, such as automated inconsistency detection, reasoning efficiency, scalability and expressivity. Ontology is the most common way to represent feature models knowledge based on DL reasoners. Previous works conceived ontologies for feature modeling either based on OWL classes and properties or based on OWL individuals. However, considering change or evolution scenarios of feature models, we need to compare whether a class-based or an individual-based feature modeling style is recommended to describe feature models to support SPLs, and especially its capabilities to deal with changes in feature models, as required by DSPLs. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to empirically compare two approaches based on each one of these modeling styles in several changing scenarios (e.g., add/remove mandatory feature, add/remove optional feature and so on). We measure time to perform changes, structural impact of changes (flexibility) and correctness for performing changes in our experiment. Our results indicate that using OWL individuals requires less time to change and is more flexible than using OWL classes and properties. These results provide insightful assumptions towards the definition of an approach relying on reasoning capabilities of ontologies that can effectively support products reconfiguration in the context of DSPL.},

@article{Perrouin:2012,
	Abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPL) are difficult to validate due to combinatorics induced by variability, which in turn leads to combinatorial explosion of the number of derivable products. Exhaustive testing in such a large products space is hardly feasible. Hence, one possible option is to test SPLs by generating test configurations that cover all possible t feature interactions (t-wise). It dramatically reduces the number of test products while ensuring reasonable SPL coverage. In this paper, we report our experience on applying t-wise techniques for SPL with two independent toolsets developed by the authors. One focuses on generality and splits the generation problem according to strategies. The other emphasizes providing efficient generation. To evaluate the respective merits of the approaches, measures such as the number of generated test configurations and the similarity between them are provided. By applying these measures, we were able to derive useful insights for pairwise and t-wise testing of product lines.},

	Abstract = {Mistakes made when implementing or specifying the models of a Software Product Line (SPL) can result in ill-formed products --- the safe composition problem. Such problem can hinder productivity and it might be hard to detect, since SPLs can have thousands of products. In this article, we propose a language independent approach for verifying safe composition of SPLs with dedicated Configuration Knowledge models. We translate feature model and Configuration Knowledge into propositional logic and use the Alloy Analyzer to perform the verification. To provide evidence for the generality of our approach, we instantiate this approach in different compositional settings. We deal with different kinds of assets such as use case scenarios and Eclipse RCP components. We analyze both the code and the requirements for a larger scale SPL, finding problems that affect thousands of products in minutes. Moreover, our evaluation suggests that the analysis time grows linearly with respect to the number of products in the analyzed SPLs.},

@article{Galindo:2015,
	Abstract = {Context
In industrial settings products are developed by more than one organization. Software vendors and suppliers commonly typically maintain their own product lines, which contribute to a larger (multi) product line or software ecosystem. It is unrealistic to assume that the participating organizations will agree on using a specific variability modeling technique---they will rather use different approaches and tools to manage the variability of their systems.
Objective
We aim to support product configuration in software ecosystems based on several variability models with different semantics that have been created using different notations.
Method
We present an integrative approach that provides a unified perspective to users configuring products in multi product line environments, regardless of the different modeling methods and tools used internally. We also present a technical infrastructure and a prototype implementation based on web services.
Results
We show the feasibility of the approach and its implementation by using it with the three most widespread types of variability modeling approaches in the product line community, i.e., feature-based, OVM-style, and decision-oriented modeling. To demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of our approach, we present an example derived from industrial experience in enterprise resource planning. We further applied the approach to support the configuration of privacy settings in the Android ecosystem based on multiple variability models. We also evaluated the performance of different model enactment strategies used in our approach.
Conclusions
Tools and techniques allowing stakeholders to handle variability in a uniform manner can considerably foster the initiation and growth of software ecosystems from the perspective of software reuse and configuration.},

	Abstract = {The increasing demand for highly customizable manufacturing systems leads to an extreme number of possible machine variants. Feature models are often used to manage this system diversity. The development and maintenance of feature models are error-prone and time-consuming tasks, especially considering industrial-size models with thousands of features. In many cases, engineers might want to focus only on a few features relevant for their own domain. Additionally, each change may lead to anomalies in the feature model. In this paper, we present an approach to provide engineering support by giving user-friendly explanations for hidden dependencies and anomalies in feature models.},

@article{Asadi:2014a,
	Abstract = {Context
A software product line is a family of software systems that share some common features but also have significant variabilities. A feature model is a variability modeling artifact, which represents differences among software products with respect to the variability relationships among their features. Having a feature model along with a reference model developed in the domain engineering lifecycle, a concrete product of the family is derived by binding the variation points in the feature model (called configuration process) and by instantiating the reference model.
Objective
In this work we address the feature model configuration problem and propose a framework to automatically select suitable features that satisfy both the functional and non-functional preferences and constraints of stakeholders. Additionally, interdependencies between various non-functional properties are taken into account in the framework.
Method
The proposed framework combines Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) to compute the non-functional properties weights based on stakeholders' preferences and interdependencies between non-functional properties. Afterwards, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is applied to find the optimal feature model configuration.
Result
Our approach improves state-of-art of feature model configuration by considering positive or negative impacts of the features on non-functional properties, the stakeholders' preferences, and non-functional interdependencies. The approach presented in this paper extends earlier work presented in [1] from several distinct perspectives including mechanisms handling interdependencies between non-functional properties, proposing a novel tooling architecture, and offering visualization and interaction techniques for representing functional and non-functional aspects of feature models.
Conclusion
our experiments show the scalability of our configuration approach when considering both functional and non-functional requirements of stakeholders.},

	Abstract = {Abstract OntoREM is an Ontology-driven Requirements Engineering Methodology (process, methods and tools) that aims to improve the quality of requirements while also reducing the time and cost needed to develop, maintain and re-use requirements. In order to evaluate the potential of such an ontology-driven approach, OntoREM was applied to the aircraft operability (AO) domain and generic AO requirements for the wing design were developed. These requirements were subsequently compared to corresponding AO requirements that were developed for the wing design of two different development contexts for which a traditional requirements process was applied. Similarly, the elapsed process times to develop the requirements were compared, as measured for OntoREM and estimated for the traditional requirements process. The preliminary outcomes of this case study strongly suggest that the application of the OntoREM approach led to better quality requirements in considerably less time and hence at less cost per requirement. Further saving potential exists through increasing automation of OntoREM. In addition, there are several, additional advantages of applying this methodology that, for example, enable the reuse of domain ontologies including requirements in even less time i.e. at lower cost in the future, not to mention the advantages of explicitly capturing domain knowledge. An industrial scale pilot application of OntoREM has been proposed in order to mature the methodology and its underlying IT infrastructure for the anticipated global use in the context of entire aircraft development programmes in order to prepare for full integration into the Airbus Product Development Process (PDP).},

	Abstract = {Software system user requirements tend to change and evolve over time. The UML activity diagrams are a useful language for modeling system processes. Additionally, designers must often maintain activity diagrams incrementally. This paper presents the CDADE tool, which can help designers detect conflicts in activity diagram evolution. The CDADE tool is composed of ontologies, metadata, and conflict detection rules. Speech act theory is used to reveal evolutionary change in the activity diagrams. The CDADE prototype and a case study of electronic commerce are presented to demonstrate and validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the CDADE tool.},

@article{Guo:2012,
	Abstract = {Software product line (SPL) techniques handle the construction of customized systems. One of the most common representations of the decisions a customer can make in SPLs is feature models (FMs). An FM represents the relationships among common and variable features in an SPL. Features are a representation of the characteristics in a system that are relevant to customers. FMs are subject to change since the set of features and their relationships can change along an SPL lifecycle. Due to this evolution, the consistency of FMs may be compromised. There exist some approaches to detect and explain inconsistencies in FMs, however this process can take a long time for large FMs. In this paper we present a complementary approach to dealing with inconsistencies in FM evolution scenarios that improves the performance for existing approaches reducing the impact of change to the smallest part of an FM that changes. To achieve our goal, we formalize FMs from an ontological perspective and define constraints that must be satisfied in FMs to be consistent. We define a set of primitive operations that modify FMs and which are responsible for the FM evolution, analyzing their impact on the FM consistency. We propose a set of predefined strategies to keep the consistency for error-prone operations. As a proof-of-concept we present the results of our experiments, where we check for the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in FMs with thousands of features. Although our approach is limited by the kinds of consistency constraints and the primitive operations we define, the experiments present a significant improvement in performance results in those cases where they are applicable.},

	Abstract = {Feature models are widely used in domain engineering to capture common and variant features among systems in a particular domain. However, the lack of a formal semantics and reasoning support of feature models has hindered the development of this area. Industrial experiences also show that methods and tools that can support feature model analysis are badly appreciated. Such reasoning tool should be fully automated and efficient. At the same time, the reasoning tool should scale up well since it may need to handle hundreds or even thousands of features a that modern software systems may have. This paper presents an approach to modeling and verifying feature diagrams using Semantic Web OWL ontologies. We use OWL DL ontologies to precisely capture the inter-relationships among the features in a feature diagram. OWL reasoning engines such as FaCT++ are deployed to check for the inconsistencies of feature configurations fully automatically. Furthermore, a general OWL debugger has been developed to tackle the disadvantage of lacking debugging aids for the current OWL reasoner and to complement our verification approach. We also developed a CASE tool to facilitate visual development, interchange and reasoning of feature diagrams in the Semantic Web environment.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a software architecture based on LabVIEW for controlling discrete event systems. The proposed architecture is an adaptation of the producer--consumer design pattern. This work uses the control software of a multifunctional robotic end-effector as a test-bed for analyzing the applicability of the software architecture and its limitations and advantages. This case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the architecture for dealing with the integration of multiple functionalities in the control system. For this case study, the validation of the architecture is performed using two verification techniques: (1) a formal verification using timed automata and the UPPAAL model checker and (2) the CoFI (Conformance and Fault Injection) method for defining the set of test cases to check the software product. Both verification techniques identified errors that were introduced into the control system during the programming phase.},

@article{Memon:2007,
	Abstract = {Abstract Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are by far the most popular means used to interact with today's software. The functional correctness of a GUI is required to ensure the safety, robustness and usability of an entire software system. GUI testing techniques used in practice are resource intensive; model-based automated techniques are rarely employed. A key reason for the reluctance in the adoption of model-based solutions proposed by researchers is their limited applicability; moreover, the models are expensive to create. Over the past few years, the present author has been developing different models for various aspects of GUI testing. This paper consolidates all of the models into one scalable event-flow model and outlines algorithms to semi-automatically reverse-engineer the model from an implementation. Earlier work on model-based test-case generation, test-oracle creation, coverage evaluation, and regression testing is recast in terms of this model by defining event-space exploration strategies (ESESs) and creating an end-to-end GUI testing process. Three such ESESs are described: for checking the event-flow model, test-case generation, and test-oracle creation. Two demonstrational scenarios show the application of the model and the three ESESs for experimentation and application in GUI testing. Copyright {\copyright} 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Belli:2016,
	Abstract = {This paper rigorously introduces the concept of model-based mutation testing (MBMT) and positions it in the landscape of mutation testing. Two elementary mutation operators, insertion and omission, are exemplarily applied to a hierarchy of graph-based models of increasing expressive power including directed graphs, event sequence graphs, finite-state machines and statecharts. Test cases generated based on the mutated models (mutants) are used to determine not only whether each mutant can be killed but also whether there are any faults in the corresponding system under consideration (SUC) developed based on the original model. Novelties of our approach are: (1) evaluation of the fault detection capability (in terms of revealing faults in the SUC) of test sets generated based on the mutated models, and (2) superseding of the great variety of existing mutation operators by iterations and combinations of the two proposed elementary operators. Three case studies were conducted on industrial and commercial real-life systems to demonstrate the feasibility of using the proposed MBMT approach in detecting faults in SUC, and to analyze its characteristic features. Our experimental data suggest that test sets generated based on the mutated models created by insertion operators are more effective in revealing faults in SUC than those generated by omission operators. Worth noting is that test sets following the MBMT approach were able to detect faults in the systems that were tested by manufacturers and independent testing organizations before they were released.},

@article{Tom:2013,
	Abstract = {Context
Whilst technical debt is considered to be detrimental to the long term success of software development, it appears to be poorly understood in academic literature. The absence of a clear definition and model for technical debt exacerbates the challenge of its identification and adequate management, thus preventing the realisation of technical debt's utility as a conceptual and technical communication device.
Objective
To make a critical examination of technical debt and consolidate understanding of the nature of technical debt and its implications for software development.
Method
An exploratory case study technique that involves multivocal literature review, supplemented by interviews with software practitioners and academics to establish the boundaries of the technical debt phenomenon.
Result
A key outcome of this research is the creation of a theoretical framework that provides a holistic view of technical debt comprising a set of technical debts dimensions, attributes, precedents and outcomes, as well as the phenomenon itself and a taxonomy that describes and encompasses different forms of the technical debt phenomenon.
Conclusion
The proposed framework provides a useful approach to understanding the overall phenomenon of technical debt for practical purposes. Future research should incorporate empirical studies to validate heuristics and techniques that will assist practitioners in their management of technical debt.},

@mastersthesis{Lindgren:2012,
	Abstract = {There is a gap in the understanding of software quality between developers and non-technical stakeholders, the software quality gap, which leads to disagreements about the amount of time that should be used for quality improvements. The technical debt metaphor reduces this gap some by describing software quality in economic terms, enabling developers and non-technical stakeholders to communicate about the quality. However, the metaphor is vague and not very concrete in explaining the gap. The purpose of this thesis is to concretize the technical debt metaphor using Domain-Driven Design, an approach in which communicating software characteristics is central, in order to reduce the software quality gap further. Using the terminology of Domain-Driven Design, a new concept is defined: model debt, which measures and communicates the software quality of the domain model. An application is built, the ModelDebtOMeter, which extracts the domain model of a software system and visualizes it along with its corresponding model debt. The model debt of a legacy system is amortized and the results of the amortizations are presented to the non-technical stakeholders of the system using the ModelDebtOMeter, allowing the non-technical stakeholders to evaluate the model debt concept. The results show that the non-technical stakeholders think that model debt is an understandable concept which reduces, but not eliminates, the software quality gap. },

@article{Seaman:2011,
	Abstract = {Technical debt is a metaphor for immature, incomplete, or inadequate artifacts in the software development lifecycle that cause higher costs and lower quality in the long run. These artifacts remaining in a system affect subsequent development and maintenance activities, and so can be seen as a type of debt that the system developers owe the system. Incurring technical debt may speed up software development in the short run, but such benefit is achieved at the cost of extra work in the future, as if paying interest on the debt. In this sense, the technical debt metaphor characterizes the relationship between the short-term benefits of delaying certain software maintenance tasks or doing them quickly and less carefully, and the long-term cost of those delays. However, managing technical debt is more complicated than managing financial debt because of the uncertainty involved. In this chapter, the authors review the main issues associated with technical debt, and propose a technical debt management framework and a research plan for validation. The objective of our research agenda is to develop and validate a comprehensive technical debt theory that formalizes the relationship between the cost and benefit sides of the concept. Further, we propose to use the theory to propose mechanisms (processes and tools) for measuring and managing technical debt in software product maintenance. The theory and management mechanisms are intended ultimately to contribute to the improved quality of software and facilitate decision making in software maintenance.},

	Abstract = {Context
In Information and Communication Technology (ICT) projects, leadership interactions affect project team performance and so influence the outcomes of projects. While aspects of team performance have been vastly researched, leadership skills and interactions specific to the challenges of ICT project environments remain less investigated.
Objective
A taxonomy of leadership interactions is developed and descriptions of interactions are collected to form a framework of leadership interactions that support team performance in ICT projects.
Method
A systematic literature review was conducted to find resources on supportive leadership interactions in ICT project teams, including categorization schemas of leadership functions and behaviors. The review was limited by the selection of sources to be searched and comprises articles from 1977 until early 2014. The developed taxonomy was compared to benchmark work on team leadership. Risks and challenges of leading ICT project teams as well as descriptions of interactions were collected.
Results
Throughout the search process, 2780 articles were examined, 218 of which were included in the review. 62 articles qualified to be accepted, 156 were rejected. 20 (including 4 meta-studies) papers holding leadership interaction categories were selected as taxonomy papers. The developed taxonomy holds 18 key dimensions of leadership team interaction. 13 areas of risks and challenges were discerned. 262 leadership interaction descriptions relevant in ICT project teams were retrieved.
Conclusions
In collected studies, the categories ``systems sensing'', ``planning and scheduling'', ``coaching'', as well as ``monitoring and controlling'' were highly developed. Many risks deal with project complexity and interpersonal processes. However, leadership interactions addressing these challenges are scarce, indicating a research gap. Furthermore, prominent leadership team interactions such as monitoring or consulting may need to be adapted to deal with challenges specific to ICT project teams. Few studies describe best-practice examples of leadership interaction in ICT teams.},

Software measurement programs (MPs) are an important means for understanding, evaluating, managing, and improving software processes, products and resources. However, implementing successful MPs still remains a challenge.
Objectives
To make a comprehensive review of the studies on MPs for bringing into light the existing measurement planning models and tools used for implementing MPs,the accumulated knowledge on the success/failure factors of MPs and mitigation strategies to address their challenges.
Methods
A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted. In total, 65primary studies were reviewed and analyzed.
Results
We identified 35 measurement planning models and 11 associated tools, most of which either proposed extensions or improvements for goal based approaches. The identified success factors include (a) organizational adoption of MP, (b) integration of MP with SDLC, (c) synchronization of MP with SPI and (d) design of MP. The mostly mentioned mitigation strategies for addressing challenges are effective change management and measurement stakeholder management, automated tool support and incorporation of engineering mechanisms for designing sustainable, effective, scalable and extendible MPs, and measurement expertise and standards development.
Conclusion
Most of the success factors and mitigation strategies have interdependencies. Therefore, for successful MP implementation, software organizations should consider these factors in combination and make a feasibility study at the very beginning.},

	Abstract = {Context: Software engineering for ubiquitous systems has experienced an important and rapid growth, however the vast research corpus makes it difficult to obtain valuable information from it. Objective: To identify, evaluate, and synthesize research about the most relevant approaches addressing the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of papers presenting and evaluating approaches for the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Approaches were classified according to the phase of the development cycle they addressed, identifying their main concerns and limitations. Results: We identified 128 papers reporting 132 approaches addressing issues related to different phases of the software development cycle for ubiquitous systems. Most approaches have been aimed at addressing the implementation, evolution/maintenance, and feedback phases, while others phases such as testing need more attention from researchers. Conclusion: We recommend to follow existing guidelines when conducting case studies to make the studies more reproducible and closer to real life cases. While some phases of the development cycle have been extensively explored, there is still room for research in other phases, toward a more agile and integrated cycle, from requirements to testing and feedback.},

	Abstract = {Context
Agile approaches are an alternative for organizations developing software, particularly for those who develop Web applications. Besides, CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) models are well-established approaches focused on assessing the maturity of an organization that develops software. Web Engineering is the field of Software Engineering responsible for analyzing and studying the specific characteristics of the Web. The suitability of an Agile approach to help organizations reach a certain CMMI maturity level in Web environments will be very interesting, as they will be able to keep the ability to quickly react and adapt to changes as long as their development processes get mature.
Objective
This paper responds to whether it is feasible or not, for an organization developing Web systems, to achieve a certain maturity level of the CMMI-DEV model using Agile methods.
Method
The proposal is analyzed by means of a systematic literature review of the relevant approaches in the field, defining a characterization schema in order to compare them to introduce the current state-of-the-art.
Results
The results achieved after the systematic literature review are presented, analyzed and compared against the defined schema, extracting relevant conclusions for the different dimensions of the problem: compatibility, compliance, experience, maturity and Web.
Conclusion
It is concluded that although the definition of an Agile approach to meet the different CMMI maturity levels goals could be possible for an organization developing Web systems, there is still a lack of detailed studies and analysis on the field.},

	Abstract = {Context
The number of maturity models proposed in the area of Business Process Management (BPM) has increased considerably in the last decade. However, there are a number of challenges, such as the limited empirical studies on their validation and a limited extent of actionable properties of these models in guiding their application. These challenges hinder the widespread usage of the maturity models in the BPM field.
Objective
In order to better understand the state of the research on business process maturity models (BPMMs) and identify opportunities for future research, we conducted a systematic literature review.
Method
We searched the studies between the years 1990 and 2014 in established digital libraries to identify empirical studies of BPMMs by focusing on their development, validation, and application. We targeted studies on generic models proposed for business process maturity, business process management or orientation maturity, and selected 61 studies out of 2899 retrieved initially.
Results
We found that despite that many BPMMs were proposed in the last decade, the level of empirical evidence that reveals the validity and usefulness of these models is scarce.
Conclusion
The current state of research on BPM maturity is in its early phases, and academic literature lacks methodical applications of many mainstream BPMMs that have been proposed. Future research should be directed towards: (1) reconciling existing models with a strong emphasis on prescriptive properties, (2) conducting empirical studies to demonstrate the validity and usefulness of BPMMs, and (3) separating the assessment method used to evaluate the maturity level from the maturity model which acts as the reference framework for the assessment.},

	Abstract = {Context: The global software industry and the software engineering (SE) academia are two large communities. However, unfortunately, the level of joint industry-academia collaborations in SE is still relatively very low, compared to the amount of activity in each of the two communities. It seems that the two 'camps' show only limited interest/motivation to collaborate with one other. Many researchers and practitioners have written about the challenges, success patterns (what to do, i.e., how to collaborate) and anti-patterns (what not do do) for industry-academia collaborations. Objective: To identify (a) the challenges to avoid risks to the collaboration by being aware of the challenges, (b) the best practices to provide an inventory of practices (patterns) allowing for an informed choice of practices to use when planning and conducting collaborative projects. Method: A systematic review has been conducted. Synthesis has been done using grounded-theory based coding procedures. Results: Through thematic analysis we identified 10 challenge themes and 17 best practice themes. A key outcome was the inventory of best practices, the most common ones recommended in different contexts were to hold regular workshops and seminars with industry, assure continuous learning from industry and academic sides, ensure management engagement, the need for a champion, basing research on real-world problems, showing explicit benefits to the industry partner, be agile during the collaboration, and the co-location of the researcher on the industry side. Conclusion: Given the importance of industry-academia collaboration to conduct research of high practical relevance we provide a synthesis of challenges and best practices, which can be used by researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions on how to structure their collaborations.},

This creates unique challenges when introducing agile at scale, when development teams must synchronize their activities, and there might be a need to interface with other organizational units. In this paper we present a systematic literature review on how agile methods and lean software development has been adopted at scale, focusing on reported challenges and success factors in the transformation. We conducted a systematic literature review of industrial large-scale agile transformations. Our keyword search found 1875 papers. We included 52 publications describing 42 industrial cases presenting the process of taking large-scale agile development into use. Almost 90% of the included papers were experience reports, indicating a lack of sound academic research on the topic. We identified 35 reported challenges grouped into nine categories, and 29 success factors, grouped into eleven categories. The most salient success factor categories were management support, choosing and customizing the agile model, training and coaching, and mindset and alignment.},

Global Software Development (GSD) is the process whereby software is developed by different teams located in various parts of the globe. One of the major reasons for GSD project failure is that a number of organizations endorse global development prior to understanding project management challenges for the global activity.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to identify the challenges, from the client and vendor perspectives, which can undermine the successful management of GSD projects.
Method
We followed a two-phase approach: we first identified the challenges via a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and then the identified challenges were validated using a questionnaire-based survey.
Results
Through both approaches, we identified 19 challenges important to the success of GSD project management. A comparison of the challenges identified in client and vendor organizations indicates that there are more similarities than differences between the challenges. Our results show a positive correlation between the ranks obtained from the SLR and the questionnaire ((rs(19) = 0.102), p = 0.679). The results of t-test (i.e., t = 0.299, p = 0.768>0.05) show that there is no significant difference between the findings of SLR and questionnaire.
Conclusions
GSD organizations should try to address the identified challenges when managing their global software development activities to increase the probability of project success.},

@article{Sobernig:2016,
	Abstract = {When developing domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs), software engineers have to make a number of important design decisions on the DSML itself, or on the software-development process that is applied to develop the DSML. Thus, making well-informed design decisions is a critical factor in developing DSMLs. To support this decision-making process, the model-driven development community has started to collect established design practices in terms of patterns, guidelines, story-telling, and procedural models. However, most of these documentation practices do not capture the details necessary to reuse the rationale behind these decisions in other DSML projects. In this paper, we report on a three-year research effort to compile and to empirically validate a catalog of structured decision descriptions (decision records) for UML-based DSMLs. This catalog is based on design decisions extracted from 90 DSML projects. These projects were identified---among others---via an extensive systematic literature review (SLR) for the years 2005--2012. Based on more than 8,000 candidate publications, we finally selected 84 publications for extracting design-decision data. The extracted data were evaluated quantitatively using a frequent-item-set analysis to obtain characteristic combinations of design decisions and qualitatively to document recurring documentation issues for UML-based DSMLs. We revised the collected decision records based on this evidence and made the decision-record catalog for developing UML-based DSMLs publicly available. Furthermore, our study offers insights into UML usage (e.g. diagram types) and into the adoption of UML extension techniques (e.g. metamodel extensions, profiles).},

	Abstract = {Context
Safety-Critical Systems (SCS) are becoming increasingly present in our society. A considerable amount of research effort has been invested into improving the SCS requirements engineering process as it is critical to the successful development of SCS and, in particular, the engineering of safety aspects.
Objective
This article aims to investigate which approaches have been proposed to elicit, model, specify and validate safety requirements in the context of SCS, as well as to what extent such approaches have been validated in industrial settings. The paper will also investigate how the usability and usefulness of the reported approaches have been explored, and to what extent they enable requirements communication among the development project/team actors in the development of SCS.
Method
We conducted a systematic literature review by selecting 151 papers published between 1983 and 2014. The research methodology to conduct the SLR was based on the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Biolchini.
Results
The results of this systematic review should encourage further research into the design of studies to improve the requirements engineering for SCS, particularly to enable the communication of the safety requirements among the project team actors, and the adoption of other models for hazard and accident models. The presented results point to the need for more industry-oriented studies, particularly with more participation of practitioners in the validation of new approaches.
Conclusion
The most relevant findings from this review and their implications for further research are as follows: integration between requirements engineering and safety engineering areas; dominance of the traditional approaches; early mortality of new approaches; need for industry validation; lack of evidence for the usefulness and usability of most approaches; and the lack of studies that investigate how to improve the communication process throughout the lifecycle. Based on the findings, we suggest a research agenda to the community of researchers and advices to SCS practitioners.},

	Abstract = {Context: Software product lines (SPLs) have reached a considerable level of adoption in the software industry, having demonstrated their cost-effectiveness for developing higher quality products with lower costs. For this reason, in the last years the requirements engineering community has devoted much effort to the development of a myriad of requirements modelling languages for SPLs. Objective: In this paper, we review and synthesize the current state of research of requirements modelling languages used in SPLs with respect to their degree of empirical validation, origin and context of use, level of expressiveness, maturity, and industry adoption. Method: We have conducted a systematic literature review with six research questions that cover the main objective. It includes 54 studies, published from 2000 to 2013. Results: The mean level of maturity of the modelling languages is 2.59 over 5, with 46% of them falling within level 2 or below -no implemented abstract syntax reported-. They show a level of expressiveness of 0.7 over 1.0. Some constructs (feature, mandatory, optional, alternative, exclude and require) are present in all the languages, while others (cardinality, attribute, constraint and label) are less common. Only 6% of the languages have been empirically validated, 41% report some kind of industry adoption and 71% of the languages are independent from any development process. Last but not least, 57% of the languages have been proposed by the academia, while 43% have been the result of a joint effort between academia and industry. Conclusions: Research on requirements modeling languages for SPLs has generated a myriad of languages that differ in the set of constructs provided to express SPL requirements. Their general lack of empirical validation and adoption in industry, together with their differences in maturity, draws the picture of a discipline that still needs to evolve.},

	Abstract = {Context
Software systems today often interoperate with each other, thus forming a system of systems (SoS). Due to the scale, complexity, and heterogeneity of SoS, determining compliance with their requirements is challenging, despite the range of existing monitoring approaches. The fragmented research landscape and the diversity of existing approaches, however, make it hard to understand and analyze existing research regarding its suitability for SoS.
Objective
The aims of this paper are thus to systematically identify, describe, and classify existing approaches for requirements-based monitoring of software systems at runtime. Specifically, we (i) analyze the characteristics and application areas of monitoring approaches proposed in different domains, we (ii) systematically identify frameworks supporting requirements monitoring, and finally (iii) analyze their support for requirements monitoring in SoS.
Method
We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify existing monitoring approaches and to classify their key characteristics and application areas. Based on this analysis we selected requirements monitoring frameworks, following a definition by Robinson, and analyzed them regarding their support for requirements monitoring in SoS.
Results
We identified 330 publications, which we used to produce a comprehensive overview of the landscape of requirements monitoring approaches. We analyzed these publications regarding their support for Robinson's requirements monitoring layers, resulting in 37 identified frameworks. We investigated how well these frameworks support requirements monitoring in SoS.
Conclusions
We conclude that most existing approaches are restricted to certain kinds of checks, particular types of events and data, and mostly also limited to one particular architectural style and technology. This lack of flexibility makes their application in an SoS context difficult. Also, systematic and automated variability management is still missing. Regarding their evaluation, many existing frameworks focus on measuring the performance overhead, while only few frameworks have been assessed in cases studies with real-world systems.},

Objective: This work identifies existing approaches to SAKM and analyzes them in terms of their support for central architecture knowledge management activities, i.e., capturing, using, maintaining, sharing, and reuse of architectural knowledge, along with presenting the evidence provided for this support. Method: A systematic literature review has been conducted for identifying and analyzing SAKM approaches, covering work published between January 2004 and August 2015. We identified 56 different approaches to SAKM based on 115 studies. We analyzed each approach in terms of its focus and support for important architecture knowledge management activities and in terms of the provided level of evidence for each supported activity. Results: Most of the developed approaches focus on using already-captured knowledge. Using is also the best-validated activity. The problem of efficient capturing is still not sufficiently addressed, and only a few approaches specifically address reuse, sharing, and, especially, maintaining. Conclusions: Without adequate support for other core architecture knowledge management activities besides using, the adoption of SAKM in practice will remain an elusive target. The problem of efficient capturing is still unsolved, as is the problem of maintaining captured knowledge over the long term. We also need more case studies and replication studies providing evidence for the usefulness of developed support for SAKM activities, as well as better reporting on these case studies.},

	Abstract = {Context: Component-based software systems require decisions on component origins for acquiring components. A component origin is an alternative of where to get a component from. Objective: To identify factors that could influence the decision to choose among different component origins and solutions for decision-making (For example, optimization) in the literature. Method: A systematic review study of peer-reviewed literature has been conducted. Results: In total we included 24 primary studies. The component origins compared were mainly focused on in-house vs. COTS and COTS vs. OSS. We identified 11 factors affecting or influencing the decision to select a component origin. When component origins were compared, there was little evidence on the relative (either positive or negative) effect of a component origin on the factor. Most of the solutions were proposed for in-house vs. COTS selection and time, cost and reliability were the most considered factors in the solutions. Optimization models were the most commonly proposed technique used in the solutions. Conclusion: The topic of choosing component origins is a green field for research, and in great need of empirical comparisons between the component origins, as well of how to decide between different combinations of them.},

	Abstract = {Context
The increasing dependence of our society on software driven systems has led Software Reliability to become a key factor as well as making it a highly active research area with hundreds of works being published every year. It would, however, appear that this activity is much more reduced as regards how to apply representative international standards on Product Quality to industrial environments, with just a few works on Standard Based software reliability modeling (SB-SRM). This is surprising given the relevance of such International Standards in industry.
Objective
To identify and analyze the existing works on the modeling of Software Reliability based on International Standards as the starting point for a reliability assessment proposal based on ISO/IEC-25000 ``Software Product Quality Requirements and Evaluation'' (SQuaRE) series.
Method
The work methodology is based on the guidelines provided in Evidence Based Software Engineering for Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR).
Results
A total of 1820 works were obtained as a result of the SLR search, more than 800 primary studies were selected after data filtering. After scrutiny, over thirty of those were thoroughly analyze, the results obtained show a very limited application of SB-SRM particularly to industrial environment.
Conclusion
Our analysis point to the complexity of the proposed models together with the difficulties involved in applying them to the management of engineering activities as a root cause to be considered for such limited application. The various stakeholder needs are also a point of paramount importance that should be better covered if the industrial applicability of the proposed models is to be increased.},

	Abstract = {Software test process improvement (STPI) approaches are frameworks that guide software development organizations to improve their software testing process. We have identified existing STPI approaches and their characteristics (such as completeness of development, availability of information and assessment instruments, and domain limitations of the approaches) using a systematic literature review (SLR). Furthermore, two selected approaches (TPI NEXT and TMMi) are evaluated with respect to their content and assessment results in industry. As a result of this study, we have identified 18 STPI approaches and their characteristics. A detailed comparison of the content of TPI NEXT and TMMi is done. We found that many of the STPI approaches do not provide sufficient information or the approaches do not include assessment instruments. This makes it difficult to apply many approaches in industry. Greater similarities were found between TPI NEXT and TMMi and fewer differences. We conclude that numerous STPI approaches are available but not all are generally applicable for industry. One major difference between available approaches is their model representation. Even though the applied approaches generally show strong similarities, differences in the assessment results arise due to their different model representations.},

	Abstract = {Background: Spot pricing is considered as a significant supplement for building a full-fledged market economy for the Cloud ecosystem. However, it seems that both providers and consumers are still hesitating to enter the Cloud spot market. The relevant academic community also has conflicting opinions about Cloud spot pricing in terms of revenue generation. Aim: This work aims to systematically identify, assess, synthesize and report the published evidence in favor of or against spot-price scheme compared with fixed-price scheme of Cloud computing, so as to help relieve the aforementioned conflict. Method: We employed the systematic literature review (SLR) method to collect and investigate the empirical studies of Cloud spot pricing indexed by major electronic libraries. Results: This SLR identified 61 primary studies that either delivered discussions or conducted experiments to perform comparison between spot pricing and fixed pricing in the Cloud domain. The reported benefits and limitations were summarized to facilitate cost-benefit analysis of being a Cloud spot pricing player, while four types of theories were distinguished to help both researchers and practitioners better understand the Cloud spot market. Conclusions: This SLR shows that the academic community strongly advocates the emerging Cloud spot market. Although there is still a lack of practical and easily deployable market-driven mechanisms, the overall findings of our work indicate that spot pricing plays a promising role in the sustainability of Cloud resource exploitation.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has yet been performed with a focus on the use of EEE techniques in SDEE. The purpose of this review is to analyze EEE techniques from six viewpoints: single models used to construct ensembles, ensemble estimation accuracy, rules used to combine single estimates, accuracy comparison of EEE techniques with single models, accuracy comparison between EEE techniques and methodologies used to construct ensemble methods. We performed a systematic review of EEE studies published between 2000 and 2016, and we selected 24 of them to address the questions raised in this review. We found that EEE techniques may be separated into two types: homogeneous and heterogeneous, and that the machine learning single models are the most frequently employed in constructing EEE techniques. We also found that EEE techniques usually yield acceptable estimation accuracy, and in fact are more accurate than single models.},

	Abstract = {Context
Over the past 50years numerous studies have investigated the possible effect that software engineers' personalities may have upon their individual tasks and teamwork. These have led to an improved understanding of that relationship; however, the analysis of personality traits and their impact on the software development process is still an area under investigation and debate. Further, other than personality traits, ``team climate'' is also another factor that has also been investigated given its relationship with software teams' performance.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to investigate how software professionals' personality is associated with team climate and team performance.
Method
In this paper we detail a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the effect of software engineers' personality traits and team climate on software team performance.
Results
Our main findings include 35 primary studies that have addressed the relationship between personality and team performance without considering team climate. The findings showed that team climate comprises a wide range of factors that fall within the fields of management and behavioral sciences. Most of the studies used undergraduate students as subjects and as surrogates of software professionals.
Conclusions
The findings from this SLR would be beneficial for understanding the personality assessment of software development team members by revealing the traits of personality taxonomy, along with the measurement of the software development team working environment. These measurements would be useful in examining the success and failure possibilities of software projects in development processes.

Objective: This study analyzed the conclusions of previously published articles on the effects of TDD on internal and external software quality and productivity, comparing TDD with Test Last Development (TLD). Method: In this study, a systematic literature review has been conducted considering articles published between 1999 and 2014. Results: In about 57% of the analyzed studies, the results were validated through experiments and in 32% of them, validation was performed through a case study. The results of this analysis show that 76% of the studies have identified a significant increase in internal software quality while 88% of the studies identified a meaningful increase in external software quality. There was an increase in productivity in the academic environment, while in the industrial scenario there was a decrease in productivity. Overall, about 44% of the studies indicated lower productivity when using TDD compared to TLD. Conclusion: According to our findings, TDD yields more benefits than TLD for internal and external software quality, but it results in lower developer productivity than TLD.},

	Abstract = {Context: Many researchers have argued that providing interoperability support only considering the format and meaning (i.e. syntax and semantic) of data exchange is not enough to achieve complete, effective and meaningful collaboration. Pragmatic interoperability has been highlighted as a key requirement to enhance collaboration. However, fulfilling this requirement is not a trivial task and there is a lack of works discussing solutions to achieve this level of interoperability. Objectives: The aim of this study is to present a systematic review and mapping of the literature in order to identify, analyse and classify the published solutions to achieve pragmatic interoperability. Method: To conduct a systematic review and mapping in accordance with the guidelines proposed in the evidence-based software engineering literature. Results: Our study identified 13 papers reporting pragmatic interoperability computational solutions. The first paper in our set of selected papers was published in 2004; the main strategies used to address pragmatic interoperability issues were service discovery, composition and/or selection and ontologies. The application domain of the identified solutions was mainly e-business. In addition, most of the identified solutions were software architectures. Conclusion: Mature proposals addressing pragmatic interoperability are still rare in the literature. Although many works have discussed the importance of pragmatic interoperability, it is necessary that researchers report solutions that implement and evaluate pragmatic interoperability in order to make progress in this area.},

	Abstract = {Context
Many organizations see software test automation as a solution to decrease testing costs and to reduce cycle time in software development. However, establishment of automated testing may fail if test automation is not applied in the right time, right context and with the appropriate approach.
Objective
The decisions on when and what to automate is important since wrong decisions can lead to disappointments and major wrong expenditures (resources and efforts). To support decision making on when and what to automate, researchers and practitioners have proposed various guidelines, heuristics and factors since the early days of test automation technologies. As the number of such sources has increased, it is important to systematically categorize the current state-of-the-art and -practice, and to provide a synthesized overview.
Method
To achieve the above objective, we have performed a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) study on when and what to automate in software testing. A MLR is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). We searched the academic literature using the Google Scholar and the grey literature using the regular Google search engine.
Results
Our MLR and its results are based on 78 sources, 52 of which were grey literature and 26 were formally published sources. We used the qualitative analysis (coding) to classify the factors affecting the when- and what-to-automate questions to five groups: (1) Software Under Test (SUT)-related factors, (2) test-related factors, (3) test-tool-related factors, (4) human and organizational factors, and (5) cross-cutting and other factors. The most frequent individual factors were: need for regression testing (44 sources), economic factors (43), and maturity of SUT (39).
Conclusion
We show that current decision-support in software test automation provides reasonable advice for industry, and as a practical outcome of this research we have summarized it as a checklist that can be used by practitioners. However, we recommend developing systematic empirically-validated decision-support approaches as the existing advice is often unsystematic and based on weak empirical evidence.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Traditional portfolio management tools and methods are challenging for software companies that use agile and lean approaches, because of the complex pre-planning activities required. In this paper, traditional portfolio management tools and methods that have been conventionally used in industry and presented in literature are reviewed. Findings concerning their use in agile and lean software companies are investigated, on the basis of the literature review and semi-structured interviews conducted in 7 agile and lean software companies in Finland. The findings indicate that the studied companies do not use traditional portfolio management tools and methods in their entirety. The software companies adapted suitable components from traditional portfolio management tools and methods into their practices. They also apply new tools and methods to manage their portfolios of offerings, to cope with the dynamics required by agile and lean methods. The companies' emphasis is on using tools to facilitate immediate feedback from customers, to assess the value of offerings in their portfolio. The results showed a growing interest in using Kanban at the portfolio level to provide a visual overview of offerings.},

	Abstract = {The past decade has seen significant changes in systems development with many organizations adopting agile methodologies as a viable methodology for developing systems. An increasing number of research studies reveal the growing popularity and acceptance of agile methodologies. While most academic research has focused on adoption and adaptation of agile methods, there is very limited understanding of their post-adoption usage and incorporation within organizations. What factors explain the effective usage of agile methodologies? A synthesis of past research in Systems Development Methodologies, Information Systems implementation, Diffusion of Innovations, and Agile Methodologies was conducted to develop a research model that identifies the main factors pertinent to the propagation and effective usage of agile methodologies in organizations. The model is tested by applying it to the usage of Kanban for Software Engineering practices at BBC Worldwide, London. Insights gained from the case study are discussed.},

@article{Dennehy:2017,
	Abstract = {Managing flow is fundamental to continuous development, particularly in knowledge intensive work activities such as software development. However, while numerous articles describe flow tools and practice there is little research on their application in context. This is a significant limitation given that software development is a highly complex and socially embedded activity. This research applies activity theory (AT) to examine the adoption of flow techniques by using the multiple-case method in two companies. AT is particularly pertinent in this study as it identifies contradictions, which manifest themselves as problems such as errors or a breakdown of communication in the organisation and congruencies between flow techniques and the development context and indeed contradictions between components of flow techniques themselves. Rather than view contradictions as a threat to flow or as an argument to abandon, a theoretical contribution of this study is that it shows how contradictions and congruencies can be used to reflect, learn, and identify new ways of structuring and enacting the flow activity. It also provides an immediate practical contribution by identifying a set of lessons drawn from the cases studied that may be applicable in future implementations of flow techniques.},

@inproceedings{Tripathi:2015,
	Abstract = {In software development organizations, large-scale distributed projects pose many challenges, such as hierarchical requirements, large team size, and managing workflow. Agile methods, like Scrum, seem to have limitations in addressing those issues. Kanban offers an interesting alternative in this concern by setting work-in-progress (WIP) limits to manage flow and establishing visibility of requirements using a visual signaling system. However, only few empirical studies have investigated scaling Kanban for large organizations. To address this concern, a case study was conducted in a large multisite company to identify the challenges and possible solutions in scaling Kanban. During the study, defining WIP limits, coordinating with distributed teams, and dividing features between teams were found as major challenges. Setting WIP limits by common agreement between teams and visualizing product backlogs and teams on electronic board, with teams pulling features from the board, were found as possible solutions for overcoming the mentioned challenges.},
